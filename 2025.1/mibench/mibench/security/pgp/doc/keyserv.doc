PGP Public Keyservers
---------------------

There are PGP public key servers which allow one to exchange public
keys running through the Internet and UUCP mail systems.


NOTE!

This service is NOT supported in any way whatsoever by the schools or
organizations on which these servers run.  It is here only to help
transfer keys between PGP users.  It does NOT attempt to guarantee
that a key is a valid key; use the signators on a key for that kind of
security.  This service can be discontinued at any time without prior
notification.

Each keyserver processes requests in the form of mail messages.  The
commands for the server are entered on the Subject: line.

        To: pgp-public-keys@keys.pgp.net
        From: johndoe@some.site.edu
        Subject: help

Sending your key to ONE server is enough.  After it processes your
key, it will forward your add request to other servers automagically.

For example, to add your key to the keyserver, or to update your key if it is
already there, send a message similar to the following to any server:

        To: pgp-public-keys@keys.pgp.net
        From: johndoe@some.site.edu
        Subject: add

        -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
        Version: 2.6.3i

        <blah blah blah>
        -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

COMPROMISED KEYS:  Create a Key Revocation Certificate (read the PGP
docs on how to do that) and mail your key to the server once again,
with the ADD command.

Valid commands are:

Command                Message body contains
--------------------------------------------------------------------
ADD            Your PGP public key (key to add is body of msg) (-ka)
INDEX          List all PGP keys the server knows about (-kv)
VERBOSE INDEX  List all PGP keys, verbose format (-kvv)
GET            Get the whole public key ring (-kxa *)
GET <userid>   Get just that one key (-kxa <userid>)
MGET <userid>  Get all keys which match <userid>
LAST <n>       Get all keys uploaded during last <n> days
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples for the MGET command:

        MGET michael            Gets all keys which have "michael" in them
        MGET iastate            All keys which contain "iastate"
        MGET 0AF605A5|683A738B  Those two keyids

If you wish to get the entire key ring and have access to FTP, it
would be a lot more efficient to use FTP rather than e-mail. Using
e-mail, the entire key ring can generate a many part message, which
you will have to reconstruct into a single file before adding it to
your key ring.

Random keyserver:

    E-mail sent to pgp-public-keys@keys.pgp.net will be sent to a keyserver
    randomly chosen from one of:

In addition to the "traditional" keyservers, there is a commercial key
registry in operation at four11.com.  Four11 Directory Services is set
up primarily as a directory service to assist in searching for people
or groups.  Members of the service may have their key certified by
Four11 and placed on their server; a key signature from Four11
indicates that you have met their signing requirements.  At the time
of this writing, they offer "SLED Silver Signatures", which require
identification of the key holder through one of the following:

 - a mailed or faxed driver's license
 - a mailed or faxed copy of a passport
 - payment for services with a preprinted personal check which cleared

Send mail to info@four11.com or connect to http://www.four11.com/ for
more information on SLED/Four11 or to search their server.  Their
current certification keys may be retrieved by sending mail to
key-pgp-silver@sled.com or by looking up "SLED" on the other
keyservers.
