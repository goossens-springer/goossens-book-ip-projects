Computer-Related Political Groups
=================================

This document is included in the PGP software release package.  PGP
is "Pretty Good Privacy", a public-key encryption program from Philip
Zimmermann.

PGP is a very political piece of software.  It seems appropriate to
mention here some computer-related activist groups that are concerned
with issues such as impacts of computers on society, algorithm
patents, etc.  Here is some information on these groups, provided by
each group.



The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
----------------------------------------

Last Updated: 14 June 1993
 
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) was founded in July, 1990,
to assure freedom of expression in digital media, with a particular
emphasis on applying the principles embodied in the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights to computer-based communication. 

From the beginning, EFF was determined to become an organization that
would combine technical, legal and public policy expertise, and would
apply these skills to the myriad issues and concerns that arise
whenever a new communications medium is born.

By remaining faithful to this initial vision, EFF has become an 
organized voice for the burgeoning community of nationally and inter-
nationally networked computer users.  We perform the multiple roles of
guardian, advocate and innovator, to serve and protect the public
interest in the information age.


GOALS OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION, 1993 

EFF's mission is to understand the opportunities and challenges of 
digital communications, in order to foster openness, individual 
freedom and community.  We expect to carry out our mission through
activities in the following areas:

POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND ADVOCACY.  EFF has been working to 
promote an open architecture for telecommunications by various 
means, including the Open Platform Initiative, the fight against the 
FBI's Digital Telephony wiretap proposal, and efforts to free robust 
encryption technologies from NSA control.

FOSTERING COMMUNITY.  Much of the work we have done has been directed
at fostering a sense of community in the online world.  Because we
realize that we know far less about the conditions conducive to the
formation of virtual communities than is necessary to be effective in
creating them, we will devote a large portion of our R & D resources
to developing better understanding in this area.

LEGAL SERVICES.  EFF was born to defend the rights of computer users
against overzealous and uninformed law enforcement officials.  This
continues to be an important focus of EFF's work.  We provide legal
information to individuals who request it and support for attorneys
who are litigating.  We maintain print and online legal archives,
disseminate this information, and make it available for downloading.
Our board and staff are continuously engaged in writing and speaking
about these issues. 

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT.  We have started many projects over the years
as their need became apparent.  Going forward, EFF will allocate
resources to investigate and initiate new projects.  To ensure that
our projects have the greatest impact and can reasonably be completed
with the resources available, EFF will sharpen its selection and
review process.

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
------------------------------------------------

CPSR empowers computer professionals and computer users to advocate
for the responsible use of information technology and empowers all
who use computer technology to participate in the public debate.   As
technical experts, CPSR members provide the public and policymakers
with realistic assessments of the power, promise, and limitations of 
computer technology.  As an organization of concerned citizens, CPSR
directs public attention to critical choices concerning the
applications of computing and how those choices affect society.

By matching unimpeachable technical information with policy 
development savvy, CPSR uses minimum dollars to have maximum impact
and encourages broad public participation in the shaping of 
technology policy.

Every project we undertake is based on five principles:

*  We foster and support public discussion of and public 
   responsibility for decisions involving the use of computers in 
   systems critical to society.

*  We work to dispel popular myths about the infallibility of
   technological systems.

*  We challenge the assumption that technology alone can solve 
   political and social problems.

*  We critically examine social and technical issues within 
   the computer profession, nationally and internationally.

*  We encourage the use of computer technology to improve the 
   quality of life. 


Founded in 1981 by a small group of computer scientists concerned 
about the use of computers in nuclear weapons systems, CPSR has grown
into a national public-interest alliance of computer industry 
professionals  dedicated to examining the impact of  technology on 
society.

Currently, CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and affiliations with 
similar groups worldwide.  In addition to our National Office in Palo
Alto, CPSR  maintains offices in Washington D.C. and Cambridge,
Massachusetts.


CPSR PROJECTS

As computer technology becomes increasingly pervasive, the issues 
facing us become more complex.  CPSR provides a forum where we can
examine technology's impact on our lives, the lives of our fellow 
citizens, and on society as a whole.  By sponsoring both national and
local projects, CPSR serves as a catalyst for in-depth discussion and
effective action in key areas:

     Civil Liberties and Privacy

     The 21st Century Project:  Technology Policy and Human Needs

     Workplace Issues and Participatory Design

     Reliability and Risk

In addition, CPSR's chapter-based projects and national working
groups tackle issues ranging from the development of nanotechnology
and virtual reality to computing and ethics to community computing to
computers and education.


HOW TO BECOME A MEMBER

CPSR is a democratically organized grass roots alliance.  Our 
accomplishments are the result of the member activism.  Many CPSR
members serve as national organizers

The League for Programming Freedom
----------------------------------


	   Protect Your Freedom to Write Programs
	   Join the League for Programming Freedom
		(Version of January 15, 1993)

Ten years ago, programmers were allowed to write programs using all
the techniques they knew, and providing whatever features they felt
were useful.  This is no longer the case.  New monopolies, known as
software patents and interface copyrights, have taken away our
freedom of expression and our ability to do a good job.

"Look and feel" lawsuits attempt to monopolize well-known command
languages; some have succeeded.  Copyrights on command languages
enforce gratuitous incompatibility, close opportunities for
competition, and stifle incremental improvements.

Software patents are even more dangerous; they make every design
decision in the development of a program carry a risk of a lawsuit,
with draconian pretrial seizure.  It is difficult and expensive to
find out whether the techniques you consider using are patented; it
is impossible to find out whether they will be patented in the
future.

The League for Programming Freedom is a grass-roots organization of
professors, students, businessmen, programmers and users dedicated to
bringing back the freedom to write programs.  The League is not
opposed to the legal system that Congress intended--copyright on
individual programs.  Our aim is to reverse the recent changes made
by judges in response to special interests, often explicitly
rejecting the public interest principles of the Constitution.

The League works to abolish the new monopolies by publishing
articles, talking with public officials, boycotting egregious
offenders, and in the future may intervene in court cases.  On May
24, 1989, the League picketed Lotus headquarters on account of their
lawsuits, and then again on August 2, 1990.  These marches stimulated
widespread media coverage for the issue.  We welcome suggestions for
other activities, as well as help in carrying them out.

Membership dues in the League are $42 per year for programmers,
managers and professionals; $10.50 for students; $21 for others.
Please give more if you can.  The League's funds will be used for
filing briefs; for printing handouts, buttons and signs; whatever
will persuade the courts, the legislators, and the people.  You may
not get anything personally for your dues--except for the freedom to
write programs.  The League is a non-profit corporation, but not
considered a tax-exempt charity.  However, for those self-employed in
software, the dues can be a business expense.

The League needs both activist members and members who only pay their
dues.  We also greatly need additional corporate members; contact us
for information.

If you have any questions, please write to the League, phone
(617) 433-7071, or send Internet mail to lpf@uunet.uu.net

		       Jack Larsen, President
		       Dean Anderson, Secretary
		       Steve Sisak, Treasurer

email.)


Is there anything about you which would enable your endorsement of
the LPF to impress the public?  For example, if you are or have been
a professor or an executive, or have written software that has a good
reputation, please tell us.


Would you like to help with LPF activities?


The corporate charter of the League for Programming Freedom states:

    The purpose of the corporation is to engage in the following
    activities:

    1.  To determine the existence of, and warn the public about
    restrictions and monopolies on classes of computer programs where such
    monopolies prevent or restrict the right to develop certain types of
    computer programs.

    2.  To develop countermeasures and initiatives, in the public interest,
    effective to block or otherwise prevent or restrain such monopolistic
    activities including education, research, publications, public
    assembly, legislative testimony, and intervention in court proceedings
    involving public interest issues (as a friend of the court).

    3.  To engage in any business or other activity in service of and
    related to the foregoing paragraphs that lawfully may be carried on
    by a corporation organized under Chapter 180 of the Massachusetts
    General Laws.

The officers and directors of the League will be elected annually by
the members.
