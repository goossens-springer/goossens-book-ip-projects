           Pretty Good Privacy version 2.6.3/2.6.3i - READ ME FIRST

                                  1996/01/26


The PGP 2.6.3i source code tree is able to compile both the international
version of PGP (PGP 2.6.3i) and the USA version of PGP (PGP 2.6.3).  It
includes the source code for Unix, MS-DOS, AmigaDOS, MacOS, VMS, and other
systems.


INTERNATIONAL VERSION -- PGP 2.6.3i
- -----------------------------------

Users outside the USA should use the international version of PGP, the
latest version of which is PGP 2.6.3i.

  --> For more information, read the file "readme.1st".


USA VERSION -- PGP 2.6.3
- ------------------------

Users inside the USA, because of patent laws, should use PGP 2.6.3, which
uses the RSAREF library.  This version is completely legal to use for non-
commercial purposes inside the USA.  It is not an official MIT release of
PGP; rather, it is based on the latest official MIT release (PGP 2.6.2)
together with the enhancements which are also in PGP 2.6.3i.

If you aquired a binary archive of PGP containing executables for your machine
of PGP 2.6.3, the archive should also include the files "mitlicen.txt" and
"rsalicen.txt", BOTH of which apply to PGP 2.6.3.  Be aware that much of the
documentation is slanted toward the international version of PGP.  For
example, the "mitlicen.txt" included with the PGP 2.6.3i source distribution
says that rsalicen.txt does not apply to PGP 2.6.3i.  The RSAREF license in
rsalicen.txt does, however, apply to the USA version PGP 2.6.3.

To compile PGP 2.6.3, you will need the PGP 2.6.3i source archive along with
source code for the rsaref-1.0 library, available elsewhere.  For instructions
on compiling PGP 2.6.3 versus PGP 2.6.3i, see the makefile for your computer
in the "src" directory.

Commercial users of PGP inside the USA should not use PGP 2.6.3. Instead, they
should purchase a copy of ViaCrypt PGP 2.7.1 (or later). For more information,
