# Blank lines are ignored, as is anything following a '#'.

# Whatever appears in here can be overridden on the command line,

# MyName is substring of default userid for secret key to make signatures.
# If not set, PGP will use the first key on your secret keyring (the last
# key you created) if you don't specify the user with -u
# MyName = "John Q. Public"

# The language we will be using for displaying messages to the user.  
#
# Available languages:
#   en = English (default)
#   es = Spanish, fr = French, de = German, it = Italian,
#   sv = Swedish, da = Danish, no = Norwegian, fi = Finnish,
#   nl = Dutch, pl = Polish, ru = Russian, el = Greek,
#   cz = Czech, ro = Romanian, hu = Hungarian, sr = Serbian,
#   br = Brazilian Portuguese, lt = Lithuanian, ja = Japanese

# Languages not yet available:
#   ar = Arabic, iw = Hebrew, tr = Turkish, lv = Latvian, ko = Korean,

# Character set for displaying messages and for conversion of text files.
# If you set this variable to anything else than latin1, koi8 or noconv,
# PGP will do character set conversions if TextMode = on or if you specify
# the -t option when encrypting or signing a file.
# 
# Available character sets:
#
#   latin1    - ISO-Latin/1      (ISO 8859/1)
#   cp850     - IBM codepage 850 (International)
#   cp852     - IBM codepage 852 (Eastern Europe)
#   cp860     - IBM codepage 860 (Portuguese)
#   cp866     - IBM codepage 866 (Russian)
#   alt_codes - Cyrillic         (Russian)
#   koi8      - Cyrillic         (Russian)
#   keybcs2   - KEYBCS 2         (Eastern Europe)
#   next      - NeXTSTEP
#   mac       - Macintosh
#   ascii     - 7-bit ASCII
#
# For MSDOS with a standard character set you should use cp850 to get
# correct character translations.  Russian character sets for MSDOS are
# usually alt_codes.
#
# Note that noconv, latin1, and koi8 are all treated as equivalent.
# Also note that cp852 and keybcs2 convert to/from latin2 rather that
# latin1.
#
# CharSet = cp850

# TMP is the directory name for PGP scratch files, usually a RAM disk.
# It can be overridden by the environment variable TMP.
# TMP = "e:\"

# Pager is the file viewing program used for viewing messages with -m
# If not set or set to "pgp", a built-in pager will be used.  The pager set
# in config.txt will override the environment variable PAGER.
# Pager = "list"

# ArmorLines is the maximum number of lines per packet when creating a
# transport armored file.  Set to 0 to disable splitting in parts.
ArmorLines = 0

# The following commented-out settings are *not* the defaults.
# Uncomment (remove the leading "#" character) them to get the
# non-default behaviour indicated.

# Armor = on          # Use -a flag for ASCII armor whenever applicable
# TextMode = on       # Attempt to use -t option where applicable
# ClearSig = off      # Use ASCII armor even for unencrypted signed messages
# KeepBinary = on     # Decrypt will not delete intermediate .pgp file
# Verbose = 2         # Verbose diagnostic messages
# Verbose = 0         # Be quiet
# Compress = off      # Suppress compression to aid debugging
# ShowPass = on       # Echo password when user types it
# Interactive = on    # Interactively prompt the user when adding keys (-ka)
# EncryptToSelf = on  # Encrypt all messages with your own public key
# AutoSign = off      # Don't sign new userids
# Legal_Kludge = off  # Use backwards-compatible format

# BakRing is the path to a backup copy of your secret keyring, usually
# on floppy disk.  Your secret keys will be compared with the backup copy
# when doing a keyring check (pgp -kc)

# Number of completely trusted signatures needed to make a key valid.

# Number of marginally trusted signatures needed to make a key valid.

# How many levels of introducers may introduce other introducers.

# TZFix is hours to add to time() to get GMT, for GMT timestamps.
# Since MSDOS assumes local time is US Pacific time, and pre-corrects 
# Pacific time to GMT, make TZFix=0 for California, -1 for Colorado, 
# -2 for Chicago, -3 for NY, -8 for London, -9 for Amsterdam.  
# However, if your MSDOS environmental variable TZ is properly defined 
# for your timezone, you can leave TZFix=0.  Unix systems probably 
# shouldn't need to worry about setting TZFix.
# TZFix = 0
