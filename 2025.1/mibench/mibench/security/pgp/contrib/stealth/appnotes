                    Stealth V1.1 MS-DOS Appnotes
                 17 April 1994 Christopher M. Wiles

These application notes pertain to my port of Henry Hastur's Stealth
V1.1 to the MS-DOS filesystem.

First and foremost, this PGP filter does _not_ work with an ascii-armored
text input file.  It was designed and coded for use with straight binary
files.  This is fine when your primary purpose is to exchange files via
the use of steganography, but is rather useless if one wishes to remove
and replace the PGP headers on an e-mail message.

It wouldn't be that difficult to patch the source to handle both input
and output of ascii armor.  If you want to see this modification, send
me e-mail at the below address.  I'll do it if enough people request it.

Additionally, there may be an error in Henry's README file, as included
in this package.  He states that the following command sequence invokes
PGP with Stealth as a filter:

        "pgp -ef < secrets.dat | stealth > pgp.stl"

This hasn't worked for me.  PGP hangs when it requests a recipient name
(a direct result of redirecting STDIN to SECRETS.DAT).  This works for
me:
        "pgp -ef < secrets.dat NAME | stealth > pgp.stl"

... where NAME is the recipient's name.

That's about it.  Hats off to Henry Hastur for writing the code, and to
Xenon for making it publicly available.
