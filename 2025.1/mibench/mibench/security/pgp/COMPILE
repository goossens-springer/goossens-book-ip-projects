Compile Instructions
--------------------
1)  Change directories to src.
2)  Type "make".  This will bring up a list of systems that you use to 
    plug into the new command line "make *".  Choose the one that best
    suites your system.  If this doesn't work see the src/Makefile for
    details on how to fix or modify the install process.

Clean Instructions
------------------
1)  Change directories to src.
2)  Type "make clean".  This will delete post-compile files (i.e.
    old executables, output, object files, etc...).
