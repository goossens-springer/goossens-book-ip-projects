This is Sphinx 2, one of Carnegie Mellon University's open source
large vocabulary, speaker-independent continuous speech recognition
engine. Please see the LICENSE file for terms of use.

THIS IS A RESEARCH SYSTEM.  This is also an early release
of a research system.  We know the APIs and function
names are likely to change, and that several tools need
to be made available to make this all complete.  With
your help and contributions, this can progress in response
to the needs and patches provided.

Once the system is built, try running the perl script
sphinx2-demo.  you may have to change the bang path
to perl at the top.

Please see the web site at

   http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx/ 

for up-to-date information.

sphinx2-test should run sphinx2-batch over an example
utterance of "go forward ten meters" once it's built.
