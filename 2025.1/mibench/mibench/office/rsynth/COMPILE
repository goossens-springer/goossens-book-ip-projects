Compile Instructions
--------------------
1)  Type "./configure" to configure the Makefile for your system.
2)  Type "make".  This will create the executables used by the scripts. If
    this doesn't work see the INSTALL or README file for details on how
    to fix or modify the install process.

Clean Instructions
------------------
1)  Type "make distclean".  This will delete post-compile files (i.e.
    old executables, output, object files, etc...).
