# ------------------------------- Options ------------------------------- #

####### The following are the only parts of the file you should need to edit.

# ------ Generic options ------ #

# Define the installation commands and target directories for
# executables and files.  The commands are only relevant to `make install';
# the directories also define the default search path for the
# initialization files (gs_*.ps) and the fonts.

INSTALL = install -c
INSTALL_PROGRAM = $(INSTALL) -m 755
INSTALL_DATA = $(INSTALL) -m 644

prefix = /usr/local
exec_prefix = $(prefix)
bindir = $(exec_prefix)/bin
scriptdir = $(bindir)
mandir = $(prefix)/man
man1ext = 1
man1dir = $(mandir)/man$(man1ext)
datadir = $(prefix)/share
gsdir = $(datadir)/ghostscript
gsdatadir = $(gsdir)/$(GS_DOT_VERSION)

docdir=$(gsdatadir)/doc
exdir=$(gsdatadir)/examples
GS_DOCDIR=$(docdir)

# Define the default directory/ies for the runtime initialization and
# font files.  Separate multiple directories with a :.

GS_LIB_DEFAULT=$(gsdatadir):$(gsdir)/fonts

# Define whether or not searching for initialization files should always
# look in the current directory first.  This leads to well-known security
# and confusion problems, but users insist on it.

SEARCH_HERE_FIRST=1

# Define the name of the interpreter initialization file.
# (There is no reason to change this.)

GS_INIT=gs_init.ps

# Choose generic configuration options.

# -DDEBUG
#	includes debugging features (-Z switch) in the code.
#	  Code runs substantially slower even if no debugging switches
#	  are set.
# -DNOPRIVATE
#	makes private (static) procedures and variables public,
#	  so they are visible to the debugger and profiler.
#	  No execution time or space penalty.

GENOPT=

# Define the name of the executable file.

GS=gs

# Define the directory where the IJG JPEG library sources are stored,
# and the major version of the library that is stored there.
# You may need to change this if the IJG library version changes.
# See jpeg.mak for more information.

JSRCDIR=jpeg-6a
JVERSION=6

# Define the directory where the PNG library sources are stored,
# and the version of the library that is stored there.
# You may need to change this if the libpng version changes.
# See libpng.mak for more information.

PSRCDIR=libpng
PVERSION=89

# Choose whether to use a shared version of the PNG library, and if so,
# what its name is.
# See gs.mak and make.txt for more information.

SHARE_LIBPNG=0
LIBPNG_NAME=png

# Define the directory where the zlib sources are stored.
# See zlib.mak for more information.

ZSRCDIR=zlib

# Choose whether to use a shared version of the zlib library, and if so,
# what its name is (usually libz, but sometimes libgz).
# See gs.mak and make.txt for more information.

SHARE_ZLIB=0
#ZLIB_NAME=gz
ZLIB_NAME=z

# Define how to build the library archives.  (These are not used in any
# standard configuration.)

AR=ar
ARFLAGS=qc
RANLIB=ranlib

# Define the configuration ID.  Read gs.mak carefully before changing this.

CONFIG=

# ------ Platform-specific options ------ #

# Define the name of the C compiler.  If the standard compiler for your
# platform is ANSI-compatible, leave this line commented out; if not,
# uncomment the line and insert the proper definition.

#CC=some_C_compiler

# Define the name of the linker for the final link step.
# Normally this is the same as the C compiler.

CCLD=$(CC)

# Define the other compilation flags.  Add at most one of the following:
#	-Aa -w -D_HPUX_SOURCE for the HP 400.
#	-DBSD4_2 for 4.2bsd systems.
#	-DSYSV for System V or DG/UX.
#	-DSVR4 -DSVR4_0 (not -DSYSV) for System V release 4.0.
#	-DSVR4 (not -DSYSV) for System V release 4.2 (or later) and Solaris 2.
# XCFLAGS can be set from the command line.
XCFLAGS=

CFLAGS=-O $(XCFLAGS)

# Define platform flags for ld.
# SunOS and some others want -X; Ultrix wants -x.
# SunOS 4.n may need -Bstatic.
# Apollos running DomainOS don't support -X (and -x has no effect).
# XLDFLAGS can be set from the command line.
XLDFLAGS=

LDFLAGS=$(XLDFLAGS)

# Define any extra libraries to link into the executable.
# ISC Unix 2.2 wants -linet.
# SCO Unix needs -lsocket if you aren't including the X11 driver.
# SVR4 may need -lnsl.
# (Libraries required by individual drivers are handled automatically.)

EXTRALIBS=

# Define the include switch(es) for the X11 header files.
# This can be null if handled in some other way (e.g., the files are
# in /usr/include, or the directory is supplied by an environment variable);
# in particular, SCO Xenix, Unix, and ODT just want
#XINCLUDE=
# Note that x_.h expects to find the header files in $(XINCLUDE)/X11,
# not in $(XINCLUDE).

XINCLUDE=-I/usr/local/X/include

# Define the directory/ies and library names for the X11 library files.
# XLIBDIRS is for ld and should include -L; XLIBDIR is for LD_RUN_PATH
# (dynamic libraries on SVR4) and should not include -L.
# Both can be null if these files are in the default linker search path;
# in particular, SCO Xenix, Unix, and ODT just want
#XLIBDIRS=
# X11R6 (on any platform) may need
#XLIBS=Xt SM ICE Xext X11

XLIBDIRS=-L/usr/local/X/lib
XLIBDIR=
XLIBS=Xt Xext X11

# Define whether this platform has floating point hardware:
#	FPU_TYPE=2 means floating point is faster than fixed point.
# (This is the case on some RISCs with multiple instruction dispatch.)
#	FPU_TYPE=1 means floating point is at worst only slightly slower
# than fixed point.
#	FPU_TYPE=0 means that floating point may be considerably slower.
#	FPU_TYPE=-1 means that floating point is always much slower than
# fixed point.

FPU_TYPE=1

# ------ Devices and features ------ #

# Choose the language feature(s) to include.  See gs.mak for details.

FEATURE_DEVS=level2.dev pdf.dev pipe.dev

# Choose whether to compile the .ps initialization files into the executable.
# See gs.mak for details.

COMPILE_INITS=0

# Choose whether to store band lists on files or in memory.
# The choices are 'file' or 'memory'.

BAND_LIST_STORAGE=file

# Choose which compression method to use when storing band lists in memory.
# The choices are 'lzw' or 'zlib'.  lzw is not recommended, because the
# LZW-compatible code in Ghostscript doesn't actually compress its input.

BAND_LIST_COMPRESSOR=zlib

# Choose the implementation of file I/O: 'stdio', 'fd', or 'both'.
# See gs.mak and sfilefd.c for more details.

FILE_IMPLEMENTATION=stdio

# Choose the device(s) to include.  See devs.mak for details.

# ---------------------------- End of options --------------------------- #

# Define the name of the partial makefile that specifies options --
# used in dependencies.
