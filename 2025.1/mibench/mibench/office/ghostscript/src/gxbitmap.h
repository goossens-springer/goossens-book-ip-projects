 * same as one that they have seen before, the core code passes an optional
 * ID with the property that if two bitmaps have the same ID, they are
 * guaranteed to have the same contents.  (The converse is *not* true,
 * however: two bitmaps may have different IDs and still be the same.)

 * Bitmaps are stored bit-big-endian (i.e., the 0x80 bit of the first
 * byte corresponds to x=0), as a sequence of bytes (i.e., you can't
 * do word-oriented operations on them if you're on a little-endian
 * platform like the Intel 80x86 or VAX).  Each scan line must start on
 * a `word' (long) boundary, and hence is padded to a word boundary,
 * although this should rarely be of concern, since the raster and width
 * are specified individually.  The first scan line corresponds to y=0
 * in whatever coordinate system is relevant.

 * For halftones at arbitrary angles, we provide for storing the halftone
 * data as a strip that must be shifted in X for different values of Y.  For
 * an ordinary (non-shifted) halftone that has a repetition width of W and a
 * repetition height of H, the pixel at coordinate (X,Y) corresponds to
 * halftone pixel (X mod W, Y mod H), ignoring phase; for a strip halftone
 * with strip shift S and strip height H, the pixel at (X,Y) corresponds to
 * halftone pixel ((X + S * floor(Y/H)) mod W, Y mod H).  In other words,
 * each Y increment of H shifts the strip left by S pixels.
 *
 * As for non-shifted tiles, a strip bitmap may include multiple copies
 * in X or Y to reduce loop overhead.  In this case, we must distinguish:
 *	- The height of an individual strip, which is the same as
 *	the height of the bitmap being replicated (rep_height, H);
 *	- The height of the entire bitmap (size.y).
 * Similarly, we must distinguish:
 *	- The shift per strip (rep_shift, S);
 *	- The shift for the entire bitmap (shift).
 * Note that shift = (rep_shift * size.y / rep_height) mod rep_width,
 * so the shift member of the structure is only an accelerator.  It is,
 * however, an important one, since it indicates whether the overall
 * bitmap requires shifting or not.
 *
 * If the bitmap consists of a multiple of W / gcd(S, W) copies in Y, the
 * effective shift is zero, reducing it to a tile.  For simplicity, we
 * require that if shift is non-zero, the bitmap height be less than H * W /
 * gcd(S, W).  I.e., we don't allow strip bitmaps that are large enough to
 * include a complete tile but that don't include an integral number of
 * tiles.  Requirements:
 *	rep_shift < rep_width
 *	shift = (rep_shift * (size.y / rep_height)) % rep_width
