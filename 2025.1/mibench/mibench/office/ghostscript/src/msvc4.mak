###### This section is the only part of the file you should need to edit.

# ------ Generic options ------ #

# Define the directory that will hold documentation at runtime.

GS_DOCDIR=c:/gs

# Define the default directory/ies for the runtime initialization and
# font files.  Separate multiple directories with ';'.
# Use / to indicate directories, not \.
# MSVC will not allow \'s here because it sees '\;' CPP-style as an
# illegal escape.
GS_LIB_DEFAULT=.;c:/gs/lib;c:/gs/fonts

# Define whether or not searching for initialization files should always
# look in the current directory first.  This leads to well-known security
# and confusion problems, but users insist on it.

SEARCH_HERE_FIRST=1

# Define the name of the interpreter initialization file.
# (There is no reason to change this.)

GS_INIT=gs_init.ps

# Choose generic configuration options.

# Setting DEBUG=1 includes debugging features (-Z switch) in the code.
# Code runs substantially slower even if no debugging switches are set,
# and also takes about another 25K of memory.

DEBUG=0

# Setting TDEBUG=1 includes symbol table information for the debugger,
# and also enables stack checking.  Code is substantially slower and larger.

TDEBUG=0

# Setting NOPRIVATE=1 makes private (static) procedures and variables public,
# so they are visible to the debugger and profiler.
# No execution time or space penalty, just larger .OBJ and .EXE files.

NOPRIVATE=0

# Define the name of the executable file.

GS=gswin32
GSCONSOLE=gswin32c
GSDLL=gsdll32

# To build two small executables and a large DLL use MAKEDLL=1
# To build two large executables use MAKEDLL=0

MAKEDLL=1

# Define the directory where the IJG JPEG library sources are stored,
# and the major version of the library that is stored there.
# You may need to change this if the IJG library version changes.
# See jpeg.mak for more information.

JSRCDIR=jpeg-6a
JVERSION=6

# Define the directory where the PNG library sources are stored,
# and the version of the library that is stored there.
# You may need to change this if the libpng version changes.
# See libpng.mak for more information.

PSRCDIR=libpng
PVERSION=89

# Define the directory where the zlib sources are stored.
# See zlib.mak for more information.

ZSRCDIR=zlib

# Define the configuration ID.  Read gs.mak carefully before changing this.

CONFIG=

# Define any other compilation flags.

CFLAGS=

# ------ Platform-specific options ------ #

# Define the drive, directory, and compiler name for the Microsoft C files.
# COMPDIR contains the compiler and linker (normally \msdev\bin).
# INCDIR contains the include files (normally \msdev\include).
# LIBDIR contains the library files (normally \msdev\lib).
# COMP is the full C compiler path name (normally \msdev\bin\cl).
# COMPCPP is the full C++ compiler path name (normally \msdev\bin\cl).
# COMPAUX is the compiler name for DOS utilities (normally \msdev\bin\cl).
# RCOMP is the resource compiler name (normallly \msdev\bin\rc).
# LINK is the full linker path name (normally \msdev\bin\link).
# Note that when INCDIR and LIBDIR are used, they always get a '\' appended,
#   so if you want to use the current directory, use an explicit '.'.

# you have one of these CPUs and no external FPU, set FPU_TYPE to -1 or 0.
