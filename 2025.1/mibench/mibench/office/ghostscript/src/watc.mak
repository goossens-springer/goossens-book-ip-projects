# ------------------------------- Options ------------------------------- #

###### This section is the only part of the file you should need to edit.

# ------ Generic options ------ #

# Define the directory that will hold documentation at runtime.

GS_DOCDIR=c:/gs

# Define the default directory/ies for the runtime
# initialization and font files.  Separate multiple directories with \;.
# Use / to indicate directories, not a single \.

GS_LIB_DEFAULT=.;c:/gs\;c:/gs/fonts

# Define whether or not searching for initialization files should always
# look in the current directory first.  This leads to well-known security
# and confusion problems, but users insist on it.

SEARCH_HERE_FIRST=1

# Define the name of the interpreter initialization file.
# (There is no reason to change this.)

GS_INIT=gs_init.ps

# Choose generic configuration options.

# Setting DEBUG=1 includes debugging features (-Z switch) in the code.
# Code runs substantially slower even if no debugging switches are set,
# and also takes about another 25K of memory.

DEBUG=0

# Setting TDEBUG=1 includes symbol table information for the Watcom debugger.
# (This option is NOT needed for using the Watcom profiler.)
# Code runs substantially slower, because some optimizations are disabled.

TDEBUG=0

# Setting NOPRIVATE=1 makes private (static) procedures and variables public,
# so they are visible to the debugger and profiler.
# No execution time or space penalty, just larger .OBJ and .EXE files.

NOPRIVATE=0

# Define the name of the executable file.

GS=gs386

# Define the directory where the IJG JPEG library sources are stored,
# and the major version of the library that is stored there.
# You may need to change this if the IJG library version changes.
# See jpeg.mak for more information.

JSRCDIR=jpeg-6a
JVERSION=6

# Define the directory where the PNG library sources are stored,
# and the version of the library that is stored there.
# You may need to change this if the libpng version changes.
# See libpng.mak for more information.

PSRCDIR=libpng
PVERSION=89

# Define the directory where the zlib sources are stored.
# See zlib.mak for more information.

ZSRCDIR=zlib

# Define the configuration ID.  Read gs.mak carefully before changing this.

CONFIG=

# Define any other compilation flags.  Including -DA4 makes A4 paper size
# the default for most, but not, printer drivers.

CFLAGS=

# ------ Platform-specific options ------ #

# Define which version of Watcom C we are using.
# Possible values are 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, or 10.5.
# Unfortunately, wmake can only test identity, not compare magnitudes,
# so the version must be exactly one of those strings.
WCVERSION=10.0

# Define the locations of the libraries.
LIBPATHS=LIBPATH $(%WATCOM)\lib386 LIBPATH $(%WATCOM)\lib386\dos

# Choose platform-specific options.

# Define the processor (CPU) type.  Options are 386,
# 485 (486SX or Cyrix 486SLC), 486 (486DX), or 586 (Pentium).
# Currently the only difference is that 486 and above assume
# the presence of a FPU, and the other processor types do not.

CPU_TYPE=386

# Define the math coprocessor (FPU) type.
# Options are -1 (optimize for no FPU), 0 (optimize for FPU present,
# but do not require a FPU), 87, 287, or 387.
# If CPU_TYPE is 486 or above, FPU_TYPE is implicitly set to 387,
# since 486DX and later processors include the equivalent of an 80387 on-chip.
# An xx87 option means that the executable will run only if a FPU
# of that type (or higher) is available: this is NOT currently checked
# at runtime.

FPU_TYPE=0

# ---------------------------- End of options ---------------------------- #

# Define the platform name.

PLATFORM=watc_

# Define the name of the makefile -- used in dependencies.

MAKEFILE=watc.mak

# Define additional platform compilation flags.

PLATOPT=

!include wccommon.mak

# ------ Devices and features ------ #

# Choose the language feature(s) to include.  See gs.mak for details.
# Since we have a large address space, we include some optional features.

FEATURE_DEVS=level2.dev pdf.dev

# Choose whether to compile the .ps initialization files into the executable.
# See gs.mak for details.

COMPILE_INITS=0

# Choose whether to store band lists on files or in memory.
# The choices are 'file' or 'memory'.

BAND_LIST_STORAGE=file

# Choose which compression method to use when storing band lists in memory.
# The choices are 'lzw' or 'zlib'.  lzw is not recommended, because the
# LZW-compatible code in Ghostscript doesn't actually compress its input.

BAND_LIST_COMPRESSOR=zlib

# Choose the implementation of file I/O: 'stdio', 'fd', or 'both'.
# See gs.mak and sfilefd.c for more details.

FILE_IMPLEMENTATION=stdio

# Choose the device(s) to include.  See devs.mak for details.
