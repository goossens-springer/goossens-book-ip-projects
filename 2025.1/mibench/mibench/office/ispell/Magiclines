# The following lines can be inserted into /etc/magic or
# /usr/lib/file/magic so that "file" will recognize ispell hash files.
# On some systems, these lines will need modification.  The most
# common modifications involve turning the magic number into a 16-bit
# integer (0x9602).  Some systems (e.g., Ultrix) may require an extra
# field to be added; see the documentation or comments for your magic
# file for more information.
