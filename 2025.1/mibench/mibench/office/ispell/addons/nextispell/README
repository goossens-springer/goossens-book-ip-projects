Release 0.5, 3rd of January 1995

This is a new improved release of the former internationalspell, a
spell service for the NeXT spell panel (like the one in Edit).

The new release is quicker and more reliable.

To install just type: configure.  To make TeX-style parsing be the
default, use "configure -t".  (You will have to make two configure
runs to get both TeX-style and nroff-style parsing.)  To install in
the system-wide /LocalLibrary rather than in your personal ~/Library,
you must be root, and use "configure -r" or "configure -r -t".


You need to have ispell installed with the corresponding hash files to
make use of this spell server (The spell server invokes ispell and
communicates with it via a pipe).

Major advantage:
	based on ispell
	    -> you can spellcheck any language!!
Major disadvantage:
	I can't think of any (no more)
	except that it still isn't as fast as I would like it to be

to be more specific:
	- you can spellcheck in TeX mode
	- you can spell any language you've got or produced a wordlist and a
	  *.aff file for
	- ispell can be a bit of a pain to install

to be found at cs.orst.edu in /pub/next/binaries/util/nextispell.tar.gz

Thanks to Detlev Droege and Geoff Kuenning for new ideas and thanks to
Christoph Hauert for his ever patient help.


		      ****************

Internal:

The spellserver gives ispell the text to correct bout 80 characters at
a time now, this makes it faster now. However with a huge hash file,
like the german one, ispell is still rather slow.  From time to time
the program still hangs because the reading on a pipe would block. You
will find this error in the Console.

Modify the code as you like and if you come up with anything better
let me know it.

The configuration scripts haven't been improved yet.



                ***  Some words about ispell: ***

You can get ispell from (thanks to Geoff Kuenning)

	ftp.cs.ucla.edu
	/pub/ispell

Current version:
	
International Ispell Version 3.1.00, 12/21/93

Be sure to get ispell 3.1 and not 4.0 which is something completely
different and doesn't work with my program.
