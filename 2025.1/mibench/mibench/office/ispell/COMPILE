Compile Instructions
--------------------
1)  Type "make ispell".  This will create the executables used by the
    scripts. If this doesn't work see the README file for details on how
    to fix or modify the install process.

Clean Instructions
------------------
1)  Type "make clean".  This will delete post-compile files (i.e.
    old executables, output, object files, etc...).
