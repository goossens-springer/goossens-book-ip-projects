# Report which version of a command is in use.  This version of
# "which" doesn't handle shell aliases, but it makes up for that with
# the "-a" (report all copies) switch and the fact that it returns a
# nonzero shell status if the command isn't found.
#
USAGE='Usage:  which [-a] command[s]'
#
# For each command, the full pathname of the version that will be
# selected from $PATH is reported.  If the -a switch is given,
# versions in $PATH that are overridden by earlier $PATH entries will
# also be reported.  The exit status is nonzero if none of the
# commands are found anywhere in $PATH.
