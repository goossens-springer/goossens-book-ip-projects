Compile Instructions
--------------------
1)  Type "make".  This will create the executable used by the scripts.
    See the INSTALL file if this doesn't work for additional instructions.

Clean Instructions
------------------
1)  Type "make clean".  This will delete post-compile files (i.e. 
    old executables, output, object files, etc...).
