
Introduction
============

  Congratulations! You are about to experience exceptionally high-quality
  MPEG audio.

  This plug-in is a replacement for the default MPEG audio decoder that
  comes with Winamp. MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder with support
  for output resolutions from 8 to 32 bits.

Recommendations
===============

  In order to get the most from this plug-in, it is recommended that you
  have a high-quality audio setup, including a nice sound card and good
  speakers. You can still benefit from MAD's high quality dithered output
  with any sound card, but to best enjoy the fine detail in the sound MAD
  produces, a high-end sound card with a 24-bit DAC is recommended.

Configuration
=============

  1. Start Winamp.

  2. Configure the plug-in from Winamp's Preferences panel under the
     Plug-ins/Input section. Choose the highest output resolution supported
     by your sound card (usually 8 or 16 bits, but possibly 24 or 32 for
     high-end cards.)

  3. Disable the Nullsoft MPEG audio decoder plug-in by deleting the file
     association extension list (version 2.7), unchecking the "Use for MP1,
     MP2, and MP3 files" option (version 2.666), or unchecking the "Layer
     III", "Layer II", and "Layer I" options (version 2.33 or 2.34) in its
     configuration.

     Alternatively, you could move the file in_mp3.dll out of your Winamp
     Plugins directory (usually C:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugins) and restart
     Winamp.

  4. Play MP3, MP2, or MP1 files and enjoy high quality sound.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

  Q. I can't get it to work. I get an error message whenever I try to play
     something. What's wrong?

  A. You have probably selected an output resolution unsupported by your
     sound card. Try 16 bits instead.

     Note: SB Live! cards do not support 24- or 32-bit output.

  Q. On some files, Winamp seems to play as normal except I hear no sound.
     What's wrong?

  A. The most likely cause for this is that the files were encoded with CRC
     protection, but the checksums are wrong. Some early encoders were known
     to create such files. MAD has to assume the CRCs are valid, so it
     thinks every frame in the file is corrupt, and plays silence instead.

     If you open the file info dialog and view the "Statistics" tab, you
     will probably see the number of CRC errors accumulating at the same
     rate as the number of decoded frames.

     You will have to fix these files before MAD will play them.

  Q. What is "Auto clipping attenuation"?

  A. This version of the MAD plug-in has the ability to attenuate (weaken)
     the digital signal reproduced from the MPEG audio data, so that it does
     not experience distortion from clipping. Clipping occurs when the
     signal is so strong that it exceeds the maximum representable
     amplitude, known as "full scale."

     You can attenuate the signal manually from the file info dialog, or you
     can have the signal attenuated automatically whenever clipping
     occurs. If you choose to attenuate automatically, you can further
     control how aggressively the signal is attenuated. The default setting
     should be appropriate for most circumstances, but you can adjust it in
     case the signal is attenuated too abruptly or not quickly enough.

Changes
=======

  Changes since 0.14.1b:
    - fixed a possible crash due to bad Xing header information
    - eliminated the error dialog when trying to open a (bad) file
    - increased the size of the info dialog box in preparation for an ID3v2
      tag editor

  Changes since 0.14.0b:
    - none visible; the plug-in is now linked with the new libid3tag
      library, which will eventually enable full ID3v2 support

  Changes since 0.13.0b:
    - a new, improved dithering algorithm has been implemented
    - streaming can now be disabled (to use other plug-ins with better
      streaming support)

  Changes since 0.12.5b:
    - the last complete audio frame should now always be decoded
    - Xing VBR headers are now detected and read if "Fast playing time
      calculation" is enabled
    - visuals for 24- and 32-bit output should now display correctly
    - corrected a problem decoding MPEG-2 Layer III intensity stereo 

  Changes since 0.12.4b:
    - several more performance improvements

  Changes since 0.12.3b:
    - many performance improvements
    - alias reduction is now performed on mixed short blocks

  Changes since 0.12.2b:
    - added decoding statistics to file info dialog
    - title formatting is greatly enhanced, and includes the ability to
      use conditional constructs
    - output can now be attenuated to eliminate clipping
    - MAD now supports the MPEG 2.5 format

  Changes since 0.12.1b:
    - several performance improvements

  Changes since 0.7.3b:
    - fixed a potential problem related to a thread conflict
    - changed the version numbering to coincide with the MAD source releases
    - created a PiMP installer executable

  Changes since 0.7.2a:
    - fixed a problem that could cause Winamp to crash if the File Info box
      is dismissed before the MPEG Audio length is calculated
    - fixed some ID3v2-induced problems related to determining the correct
      sample rate, et al.

  Changes since 0.7.1a:
    - a different method for packing stereo PCM samples is used which *may*
      be somewhat faster than before
    - fixed several seek-related issues; should no longer get a "blip" sound
    - slightly improved error handling on bad frames

Known Issues
============

  - there are buffering issues related to streaming support
  - the ID3v2 tag editor is missing
  - using DSP effects (including the equalizer) will negate the effects of
    dithering
