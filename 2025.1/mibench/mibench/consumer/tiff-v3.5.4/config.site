#
# This file holds site-specific configuration parameters.
#
# Nothing is defined in here by default, the definitions
# commented out below serve as documentation for what you
# can set in this file or a config.local file.
#
# Note that you do not need to set anything here unless you
# want to override the auto-configuration behaviour and/or
# interactive prompting done by the configure script.
#

#
# Package controls.
#
DSO="no"			# auto|IRIX|IRIX52 enable DSO support for system
JPEG="no"			# yes|no configure JPEG support (see below)
#ZIP="no"			# yes|no configure Deflate support (see below)
#LIBGL="auto"			# yes|no|auto configure IRIS GL-based tools
#LIBIMAGE="auto"		# yes|no|auto configure SGI RGB image tools
HTML="no"			# yes|no install HTML documentation

#
# Directory parameters.
#
DIR_BIN="bin"		# directory for tools
DIR_LIB="lib"		# directory for libraries
DIR_INC="include"		# directory for include files
DIR_MAN="man"		# directory for manual pages
DIR_HTML="httpd/htdocs/tiff"	# directory for HTML documentation

#
# Configuring supporting libraries.
#
# The TIFF software makes use of two ancillary packages: the IJG
# distribution to support the JPEG codec and the zlib distribution
# to support the Deflate codec.  To setup use of these packages you
# need to specify where each package's include files are located and
# where the pre-built library (static archive or DSO) is located.
# These may be different or the same (as when the package is compiled
# and referenced directly from the place where the software was
# loaded and compiled).
#
# DIRS_LIBINC is a space-separated list of directories to use for
# locating include files in these packages.  Note that it should not
# include -I options as might be passed to the C preprocessor; these
# are automatically added by the configure script when the Makefiles
# are generated.
#
# DIR_<package>LIB is the pathname of the directory where <package>'s
# pre-built library may be found; this is used when building a TIFF
# DSO (on systems where support is present) and when building the
# programs in the tools directory.  By default the configure script
# will load the associated library using
#
#     -L${DIR_<package>LIB} -l<package>
#
# e.g. -L${DIR_JPEGLIB} -ljpeg.  If this is wrong for your system
# (e.g. your compiler/loader does not support the -L option), then
# the LIB<package> parameter can be set explicitly to specify the
# library to use.
#

#
# JPEG-specific parameters; used when JPEG support is enabled (see above).
#
# JPEG support requires release 5 or later of the IJG code,
# which you can find on the Internet at ftp.uu.net:/graphics/jpeg/.
#
#DIRS_LIBINC="$DIRS_LIBINC ../src/jpeg-6b" # directory for jpeg include files
#DIR_JPEGLIB=../src/jpeg-6b		# directory for libjpeg

#
# Deflate-specific parameters; used when Deflate support is enabled (see above).
#
# NB: Deflate support requires version 0.92 or later of the zlib
#     library written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.  Starting
#     with about 0.95 the library is called libz.a (previously it was
#     libgz.a).  The library was last found at
#
#        ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/code/zlib-0.93.tar.gz
#
#     Look for it also at ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip/zlib.
#
#DIRS_LIBINC="$DIRS_LIBINC ../zlib"	# directory for zlib include files
#DIR_GZLIB="../zlib"			# directory for libz

#
# Miscellaneous parameters.
#
FILLORDER="MSB2LSB"			# bit order of cpu (MSB2LSB/LSB2MSB)
#MANSCHEME="sysv-source-cat-strip"	# manual page installation scheme

#
# Parameters used when building the software.
#
# Note that configure has several ENVOPTS built into it that are
# set according to the target.  This is done to help naive folks.
#
# Beware of changing the INSTALL definition; you *must* have an
# install script that emulates the Silicon Graphics install program!
#
#AR="ssbig-na-sstrix-ar"				# pathname of suitable ar program
AR="ar"				# pathname of suitable ar program
#AROPTS="rc"				# options to ar for creating archive
#CC="ssbig-na-sstrix-gcc"				# name/pathname of C compiler
CC="gcc"				# name/pathname of C compiler
#ENVOPTS="-Aa"				# options for getting ANSI C
#GCOPTS="-g"				# options to pass C compiler
#LIBPORT='${PORT}/libport.a'		# library with emulation code
#MACHDEPLIBS=""				# extra libraries for linking
#PORTFUNCS=""				# non-standard functions to emulate
#RANLIB=":"				# pathname of suitable ranlib program
#DSOSUF="so"				# DSO filename suffix
#LIBCOPTS="-K PIC"			# compiler options for building library

#
# Makefile construction parameters.
#
# These should not normally be set; configure will
# deduce the appropriate syntax to use for includes.
#
#SETMAKE='MAKE	= ${MAKE}'		# define if make does not setup $MAKE

#
# General system stuff used by the distribution.
#
#CHMOD="/etc/chmod"			# pathname of suitable chmod program
#INSTALL='${SHELL} ${PORT}/install.sh'	# SGI install program/emulator
#LN="/bin/ln"				# pathname of suitable ln program
#LN_S="-s"				# option to ${LN} to create symlink
#MV_F="-f"				# option to ${MV} to force operation
#SED="/bin/sed"				# pathname of suitable sed program
#SCRIPT_SH="/bin/sh"			# pathname of suitable shell
#STRIP="/bin/strip"			# strip program used by install.sh
