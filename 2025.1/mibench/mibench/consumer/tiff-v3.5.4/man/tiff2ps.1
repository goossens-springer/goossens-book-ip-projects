.TH TIFF2PS 1 "January 27, 1997"
.SH NAME
tiff2ps \- convert a
.SM TIFF
image to \*(Ps\(tm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tiff2ps
[
.I options
]
.I "input.tif ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I tiff2ps
reads
.SM TIFF
images and writes \*(Ps or Encapsulated \*(Ps (EPS)
on the standard output.
By default,
.I tiff2ps
writes Encapsulated \*(Ps for the first image in the specified
.SM TIFF
image file.
.PP
By default,
.I tiff2ps
will generate \*(Ps that fills a printed area specified
by the 
.SM TIFF
tags in the input file.
If the file does not contain
.I XResolution
or
.I YResolution
tags, then the printed area is set according to the image dimensions.
The
.B \-w
and
.B \-h
options (see below)
can be used to set the dimensions of the printed area in inches;
overriding any relevant
.SM TIFF
tags.
.PP
The \*(Ps generated for
.SM RGB,
palette, and
.SM CMYK
images uses the
.I colorimage
operator.
The \*(Ps generated for
greyscale and bilevel images
uses the
.I image
operator.
When the
.I colorimage
operator is used, \*(Ps code to emulate this operator
on older \*(Ps printers is also generated.
Note that this emulation code can be very slow.
.PP
Color images with associated alpha data are composited over
a white background.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-1
Generate \*(Ps Level I (the default).
.TP
.B \-2
Generate \*(Ps Level II.
.TP
.B \-a
Generate output for all IFDs (pages) in the input file.
.TP
.B \-d
Set the initial
.SM TIFF
directory to the specified directory number.
(NB: directories are numbered starting at zero.)
This option is useful for selecting individual pages in a
multi-page (e.g. facsimile) file.
.TP
.B \-e
Force the generation of Encapsulated \*(Ps.
.TP
.B \-h
Specify the vertical size of the printed area (in inches).
.TP
.B \-o
Set the initial
.SM TIFF
directory to the
.SM IFD
at the specified file offset.
This option is useful for selecting thumbnail images and the
like which are hidden using the SubIFD tag.
.TP
.B \-p
Force the generation of (non-Encapsulated) \*(Ps.
.TP
.B \-s
Generate output for a single IFD (page) in the input file.
.TP
.B \-w
Specify the horizontal size of the printed area (in inches).
.TP
.B \-z
When generating \*(Ps Level II, data is scaled so that it does not
image into the 
.I deadzone
on a page (the outer margin that the printing device is unable to mark).
This option suppresses this behaviour.
When \*(Ps Level I is generated, data is imaged to the entire printed
page and this option has no affect.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following generates \*(Ps Level II for all pages of a facsimile:
.RS
.nf
tiff2ps -a2 fax.tif | lpr
.fi
.RE
Note also that if you have version 2.6.1 or newer of Ghostscript then you
can efficiently preview facsimile generated with the above command.
.PP
To generate Encapsulated \*(Ps for a the image at directory 2
of an image use:
.RS
.nf
tiff2ps -d 1 foo.tif
.fi
.RE
(notice that directories are numbered starting at zero.)
.SH BUGS
Because \*(Ps does not support the notion of a colormap,
8-bit palette images produce 24-bit \*(Ps images.
This conversion results in output that is six times
bigger than the original image and which takes a long time
to send to a printer over a serial line.
Matters are even worse for 4-, 2-, and 1-bit palette images.
.SH BUGS
Does not handle tiled images when generating PS Level I output.
