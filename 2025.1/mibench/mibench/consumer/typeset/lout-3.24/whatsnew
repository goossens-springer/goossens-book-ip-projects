    *** IMPORTANT: TWO CHANGES THAT ARE NOT UPWARDLY COMPATIBLE ***

    (1)  The @Abstract symbol in technical reports now comes before the
	 // symbol, not after it.  See User's Guide for details.

    (2)  Setup file arrangements have changed.  You now need to have one
	 @SysInclude line for each package you use.  For example,

	    Previous versions           Version 3.13
	    ---------------------------------------------

	    @SysInclude { eq }          @SysInclude { eq }
	    @SysInclude { ddoc }        @SysInclude { diag }
				        @SysInclude { doc }

         Import clauses in mydefs files also have to change:

	    Previous versions           Version 3.13
	    ---------------------------------------------

            import @DocumentLayout      import @BasicSetup
	    import @CPrint              import @CPSetup
	    import @DiagramPrint        import @DiagSetup

         Sorry for the inconvenience, but the old system was inconsistent
	 and was tending towards an unsustainable combinatorial explosion
	 of setup files.  No changes *within* documents are needed, and
	 these new arrangements do not affect the content of the packages.
	 The user's guide documents it all.

    Bug fixes
    "lout -PDF" now available as alternative to "lout -Z"

    *** IMPORTANT: ONE CHANGE THAT IS NOT UPWARDLY COMPATIBLE ***

    If you are using your own setup file, then it is likely to contain the
    line "@SysInclude { fontdefs }".  There is no longer a fontdefs file,
    there is now a fontdefs database, so you need to replace this line with
    "@SysDatabase @FontDef { fontdefs }".
