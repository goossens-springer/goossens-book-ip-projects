These symbols
galley.sym @Index { @@Galley symbol }
galley.sym @Index { @@ForceGalley symbol }
both act as a placeholder for a galley.  That is, they may be replaced
by components of a galley.  In the case of @@ForceGalley the galley will
then have a forcing galley effect at this point although it need not be
declared using {@Code "force into"}.  See Section {@NumberOf targets}
for a detailed discussion of galleys, forcing galleys, and targets.
