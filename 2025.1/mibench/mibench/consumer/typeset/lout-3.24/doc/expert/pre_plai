plaingraphic.sym @Index { @@PlainGraphic symbol }
The @@PlainGraphic symbol is avery rudimentary analogue for plain text
output of the @@Graphic symbol for PostScript output.  Its result is
its right parameter printed on a background created by repeated
printings of its left parameter, which must be a simple word.  For
example,
@ID @Verbatim { "." @PlainGraphic 5s @Wide }
would produce five dots.  @@PlainGraphic is used in the @Code tbl
table-drawing package to produce plain-text rules.
