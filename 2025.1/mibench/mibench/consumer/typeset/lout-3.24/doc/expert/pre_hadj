vadjust. @Index { @@VAdjust symbol }
adjustment @Index { Adjustment of object }
These symbols spread their right parameter apart until it occupies
all the space available to it;  @@HAdjust adjusts @Code "|" sequences,
@@VAdjust adjusts @Code "/" sequences, and @@PAdjust adjusts @Code "&"
sequences.  For example,
@ID @Code {
"4i @Wide @PAdjust { 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 }"
}
has result
@ID {
4i @Wide @PAdjust { 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 }
}
More precisely, the widening is effected by enlarging the size of each
component except the last by an equal fraction of the space that would
otherwise be left over -- just the opposite of the usual procedure,
which assigns all the leftover space to the last component (Section
{@NumberOf size}).
@PP
@@PAdjust is used by the @Code adjust and @Code outdent options of
the @@Break symbol (Section {@NumberOf break}).  It has a slight
peculiarity:  it will not enlarge components when the immediately
following gap has width 0.  This is to prevent space from appearing
(for example) between a word and an immediately following comma.  The
other two symbols will enlarge such components.
