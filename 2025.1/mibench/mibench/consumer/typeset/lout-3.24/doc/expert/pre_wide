The @@Wide symbol
wide.sym @Index { @@Wide symbol }
returns its right parameter modified to have the width given by its left
parameter, which must be a length (Section {@NumberOf concatenation})
whose unit of measurement is {@Code "c"}, {@Code "i"}, {@Code "p"},
{@Code "m"}, {@Code "f"}, {@Code "s"}, or {@Code "v"}.  If the right
parameter is not as wide as required, white space is added at the right;
if it is too wide, its paragraphs are broken (Section {@NumberOf break})
so that it fits.  A @@OneCol operation is included in the effect of @@Wide,
since it does not make sense for an object of fixed width to have two column
marks.
@PP
high.sym @Index { @@High symbol }
The @@High symbol similarly ensures that its result is of a given height,
by adding white space at the bottom.  In this case it is an error for the
right parameter to be too large.  A @@OneRow operation is included.
