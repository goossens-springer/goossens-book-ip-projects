This manual is addressed to those who wish to become
expert users of the Lout document formatting system.  An expert user
is someone who understands the principles of document formatting
that Lout embodies, and is able to apply them, for example to design
a document format or a special-purpose package.  In contrast, a non-expert
user is someone who simply uses Lout to format documents.
@PP
Chapter {@NumberOf principles} explains these principles, and it
should be read carefully and in sequence.  Chapters {@NumberOf details}
and {@NumberOf symbols} are for reference; respectively, they
contain descriptions of the detailed operation of Lout's major
components, and a complete description of each predefined symbol.  The
final chapter presents a collection of advanced examples.
@PP
This manual presents Version 3 of Basser Lout, publicly released in
September 1994 @Cite { $kingston1995lout.program } and developed
continuously since then.  This manual was rendered into PostScript
postscript @Index { PostScript }
by Version 3.24 of the Basser Lout interpreter, using the symbols
described in the User's Guide @Cite { $kingston1995lout.user }.
@DP
@Heading { Acknowledgment. }  Version 3 has benefited from hundreds of
comments received since the release of Version 1 in October 1991.  Not
every suggestion could be followed, but many have been, and the
encouragement was greatly appreciated.
