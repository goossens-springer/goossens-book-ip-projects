verbatim.sym @Index { @@Verbatim symbol }
rawverbatim.sym @Index { @@RawVerbatim symbol }
These symbols instruct Lout to read the following text (enclosed in braces)
verbatim, that is, turning off all special character meanings.  For example,
@ID @Code @Verbatim {
@Verbatim { "hello" }
}
produces
@ID @Verbatim { "hello" }
@@Verbatim ignores all characters after the opening brace up to but not
including the first non-white-space character.  @@RawVerbatim differs from
@@Verbatim only in that it ignores all characters after the opening brace
up to but not including the first non-white-space character, or up to and
including the first newline character, whichever comes first.  This
variant is useful in cases such as
@ID @Code @Verbatim {
@RawVerbatim {
     var x: Real
begin
}
}
where the first line of the verbatim text begins with white space which
would be ignored by @@Verbatim.  Both symbols ignore all white spaces
at the end of the verbatim text, preceding the closing brace.
