insert.sym @Index { @@Insert symbol }
The @@Insert symbol inserts its left parameter at the beginning of the
first paragraph of its right parameter:
@ID @Code "X @Insert { A B // C // D }"
is equivalent to
@ID @Code "{ XA B // C // D }"
Notice that a zero-width space separates @Code { X } from the first
paragraph, so if some wider space is required it must be placed at the
end of @Code { X }.  The @Code "@Insert" operation is applied to the
value of the right parameter after evaluation.
@PP
The only known use for this symbol is to attach something like
@B { Figure 6 } to the front of a multi-paragraph caption.
