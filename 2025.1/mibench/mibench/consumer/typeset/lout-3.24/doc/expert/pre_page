pagelabel.sym @Index { @@PageLabel symbol }
The @@PageLabel symbol associates a page label in the PostScript
output file with the page within which (or just before which) the symbol
occurs, so that PostScript viewers are able to index the page
by this label.  (The label is printed in the @Code "%%Page" comment
preceding the page in the PostScript output file.)  For example,
@ID @Code "@PageLabel iv"
associates the label @Code "iv" with the page.  The label may be
an arbitrary object; if its value is not a simple word, it will
be replaced by {@Code "?"}.
@PP
@@PageLabel is unrelated to Lout's cross referencing mechanism;
it is for communicating a label to the PostScript output file, not to
other parts of Lout.  The result of @@PageLabel is a null object.
