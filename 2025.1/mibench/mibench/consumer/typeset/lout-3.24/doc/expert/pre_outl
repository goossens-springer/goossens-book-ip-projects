The @@Outline symbol
outline.sym @Index { @@Outline symbol }
causes all the words in the right parameter (which may be an
arbitrary object) to be printed in outline, rather than filled as
is usual.  For example,
@ID @Code @Verbatim { @Outline @Box 24p @Font HELP }
produces
@ID @Outline @Box 24p @Font HELP
Outlining is part of the style information, in the same way as
colour, font, underlining, and so forth.  Outlining can be applied
to any font likely to be used in practice.  At the time of writing,
there is no way to control the thickness of the outline, and
@@Outline has no effect in PDF output.  The size of outlined
words is taken by Lout to be the same as if they had not been
outlined, even though they are in reality slightly larger.
