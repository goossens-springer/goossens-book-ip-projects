hlimited. @Index { @@HLimited symbol }
vlimited. @Index { @@VLimited symbol }
The @@HLimited symbol limits the width available to recursive
and receptive symbols within its right parameter to whatever
is available without increasing the existing size of the
@@HLimited object.  So this symbol acts like @@Wide with
respect to limiting the space occupied by recursive and receptive
symbols, except that instead of enforcing a fixed constant limit,
it enforces whatever size is already in place.
@PP
The @@VLimited symbol is exactly the same, except that it
applies vertically rather than horizontally.
