hcontract. @Index { @@HContract symbol }

contraction @Index { Contraction of object }
The @@HContract symbol reduces the size of its right parameter to a
reasonable minimum (after paragraph breaking).  For example,
@ID @Code "5i @Wide @HContract { A |1rt B }"
has result
@ID { 5i @Wide @HContract { A |1rt B } }
in which the B is much closer to the A than it would otherwise have
been.  @@VContract is similar, but in a vertical direction.  See
Section {@NumberOf size} for a more extensive discussion.
