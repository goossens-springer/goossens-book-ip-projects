Directory lout/doc/design

This directory contains the Lout source files
for the report entitled `The design and
implementation of the Lout document formatting
language'  which appeared in Software--Practice
and Experience, vol 23, pp1001-1041 (September
1993).  To produce the report, type the command

	lout all > outfile.ps

in this directory.  This must be done three
times to completely resolve all cross references,
although the PostScript file outfile.ps is
printable after the first run.  Auxiliary files
with .li and .ld suffixes will be created in
this directory.  A copy of the final outfile.ps
is included.

The second and third runs should produce no error
messages (although changing the paper size might
produce one or two benign ones).
