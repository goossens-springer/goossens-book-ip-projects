With objects and definitions under control, the author faced the problem
of getting body text, footnotes, floating figures and tables,
references, index entries, and entries in the table of contents into
their places.  The resulting investigation occupied three months of

Section {@NumberOf galleys}; the implementation occupied the years 1987-89.
