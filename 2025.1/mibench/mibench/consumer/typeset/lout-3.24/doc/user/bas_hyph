The @Code "@Break" symbol also controls hyphenation:  @Code "hyphen"
hyphenation. @Index hyphenation
@Code "@Break" turns it on, @Code "nohyphen" @Code "@Break" turns it
off.  For example, ragged breaking is often done without hyphenation:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@IndentedDisplay { ragged nohyphen } @Break {"
"This little paragraph will appear with"
"ragged ends to its lines."
"}"
}
Lout's method of choosing hyphenation points is copied from the @TeX
tex.hyph @SubIndex { hyphenation }
system, except that Lout will never place a hyphen within a sequence
of characters that form a ligature (fl and
ligatures.hyph @SubIndex { and hyphenation }
fi are the most common ligatures).
@PP
Hyphenation usually works well by itself; you should never need to
interfere with its ideas of what to do.  However, if you do want
to tell Lout where you think a hyphen could be inserted, you can
use the @Code "&-" symbol:
@IndentedDisplay @Code {
"after&-math"
}
If @Code "&-" occurs directly after a hyphen character, hyphenation
will be permitted but no extra hyphen will be inserted.  To prevent
hyphenation of a word, enclose the word in a @Code "@OneCol" symbol.
@PP
To turn hyphenation off throughout the document, you need to set the
@Code "@InitialBreak" option to {@Code "nohyphen"}, as described at the
end of Section {@NumberOf linespace}.
