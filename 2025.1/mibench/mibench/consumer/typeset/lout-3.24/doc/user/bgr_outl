The @@Outline symbol
outline.sym @Index { @@Outline symbol }
causes all the words in the following object (which may be
arbitrary as usual) to be printed in outline.  For example,
@ID @Code @Verbatim { @Outline @Box 24p @Font HELP }
produces
@ID @Outline @Box 24p @Font HELP
There is no way to control the thickness of the outline, and
@@Outline has no effect in PDF output.  On the other hand,
it works with any font likely to be used in practice.
