Here is the complete, fixed list of options that you may give to the
@Code "@Reference" symbol:

   vmargin { 0.5vx }
   @Fmta { @Col @Code A ! @Col B }
{

@Rowa
    A { "    @Organization  {}" }
    B { The organization sponsoring the work }
@Rowa
    A { "    @Page  {}" }
    B { Page number if only one, for example @Code "23" }
@Rowa
    A { "    @Pages  {}" }
    B { Page numbers if more than one, for example @Code "23--47" }
@Rowa
    A { "    @Pinpoint  {}" }
    B { A point or part of the work, for example @Code "Chapter VI" }

    B { The year of publication or writing }
@Rowa
    A { "}" }
}
Every reference may contain any of these options, although, depending
on the {@Code "@Type"} option, only some will be printed.  You can't give
an option twice; in particular, multiple authors must be placed
within one @Code "@Author" option, arranged as you want them to appear.  Here
is the complete set of values that you may give to the @Code "@Type" option:
@ID @Tab
    vmargin { 0.5vx }
    @Fmta { @Col @Code A ! @Col @Code B ! @Col @Code C ! @Col @Code D }
{
 @Rowa
    A { Book }
    B { TechReport }
    C { Article }
    D { InBook }
 @Rowa
    A { Proceedings }
    B { MastersThesis }
    C {}
    D { InProceedings }
 @Rowa
    A { PhDThesis }
    B { Misc }
    C {}
    D {}
}
Each column represents one broad category of reference type:  the first
contains large works; the second contains small works not appearing
within anything else (although possibly part of a series); the third
contains small works appearing within an ongoing forum for such works;
and the fourth contains small works appearing within large works.  In each
case, the reference may be to the work as a whole, or to one point or part
of it (known as pinpointing).
@PP
Some care is needed when choosing the @Code "@Tag" option, since references
are both cited and sorted by tag.  It is best to choose a three-part
tag consisting of the first author's surname and possibly initial, the
year of publication, and a brief reminder of the contents:
@ID @Code "@Tag { kingston1995lout.expert }"
Keep to lower-case letters, since mixed cases confuse the sorting, and
give the full four digits of the year to avoid trouble in the year
2000.  Multi-word tags are possible but not recommended.
@PP
Unusually for Lout, you can have unquoted @Code "/" and @Code "~"
characters inside the @Code "@URL" option:
@ID @Code "@URL { ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/jeff/lout }"
In fact it is better not to use quotes because then Lout will
be able to break lines at @Code "/" characters, which is very useful
since URLs tend to be long and prone to causing bad line breaks.
@PP
Since the types within each broad category are similar, our plan is to
give one example of each and briefly note how the others differ.  Here
is a @Code Book entry showing all its options:
book.ref.type @Index { @Code Book reference type }
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"{ @Reference"
"     @Tag { homer.odyssey }"
"     @Type { Book }"
"     @Author { Homer }"
"     @Title { The Odyssey }"
"     @TitleNote { Translated by E. V. Rieu }"
"     @Pinpoint { Chapter VI }"
"     @Pages { 102--111 }"
"     @Page { 102 }"
"     @Publisher { Penguin Books }"
"     @Address { Harmondsworth, Middlesex }"
"     @Edition { Penguin Classics Edition }"
"     @Month { August }"
"     @Year { 1942 }"
"     @Note { The date of composition is unknown,"
"but is thought to be about the tenth century BC. }"
"}"
}
And here is what it produces:
@ID @RefPrint homer.odyssey
The only compulsory options are {@Code "@Tag"}, {@Code "@Type"}, and
{@Code "@Title"}, and Lout will carefully adjust the formatting to the
right thing when you omit others.  A basic book would have just
{@Code "@Tag"}, {@Code "@Type"}, {@Code "@Author"}, {@Code "@Title"},
{@Code "@Publisher"}, and {@Code "@Year"} options.
@PP
@Code Proceedings is similar, except you
proceedings.ref.type @Index { @Code Proceedings reference type }
may have an @Code "@Organization" or @Code "@Institution" option for
the sponsoring organization if you wish, and the author will either be
absent or an editor:
@ID @Code "@Author { P. W. Lamb, editor }"
There is no option specifically for editors, translators, and so forth.
@PP
@Code PhDThesis is very similar again, with @Code "@Institution"
phdthesis.ref.type @Index { @Code PhDThesis reference type }
instead of {@Code "@Publisher"}, and the phrase `Ph.D. thesis'
appearing by magic in the right spot.  Like all words and phrases
introduced automatically by Lout, it will be translated into the current
language if this is not English.
@PP
Moving now to the second broad category, here is a typical {@Code TechReport}:
techreport.ref.type @Index { @Code TechReport reference type }
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"{ @Reference"
"     @Tag { christofides1976tsp }"
"     @Type { TechReport }"
"     @Author { Christofides, N. }"
"     @Title { Worst-case analysis of a new heuristic"
"for the travelling salesman problem }"
"     @Number { 388 }"
"     @Institution { Graduate School of Industrial"
"Administration, Carnegie-Mellon University }"
"     @Address { Pittsburgh, PA }"
"     @Year { 1976 }"
"}"
}
Here is the result:
@ID @RefPrint christofides1976tsp
The two novelties here are the @Code "@Number" option, which is the
number of the report, and the `Tech. Rep.' phrase.  If you
need some other phrase instead, use the @Code "@TRType" option:
@ID @Code "@TRType { Programmer's Manual }"
or whatever.  The phrase will be `Master's Thesis' in the
current language for type {@Code MastersThesis}, and absent in type
mastersthesis.ref.type @Index { @Code MastersThesis reference type }
misc.ref.type @Index { @Code Misc reference type }
{@Code Misc}.  You may use the pinpointing options ({@Code "@Pinpoint"},
{@Code "@Page"}, and {@Code "@Pages"}) and {@Code "@TitleNote"},
{@Code "@Month"}, and {@Code "@Note"} in the same way as for books.
@PP
Journal articles are referenced by journal name, volume, number, and
page(s):
article.ref.type @Index { @Code Article reference type }
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"{ @Reference"
"     @Tag { kingston1993lout.design }"
"     @Type { Article }"
"     @Author { Jeffrey H. Kingston }"
"     @Title { The design and implementation of the"
"Lout document formatting language }"
"     @Journal { Software---Practice and Experience }"
"     @Volume { 23 }"
"     @Pages { 1001--1041 }"
"     @Year { 1993 }"
"}"
}
The result of this is
@ID @RefPrint kingston1993lout.design
All are optional, as usual.  Notice that @Code "@Pages" and @Code "@Page"
refer to the whole article so are not available for pinpointing here,
but you may still use {@Code "@Pinpoint"}.
@PP
Finally, small works that appear within large works have @Code "@Author"
inbook.ref.type @Index { @Code InBook reference type }
and @Code "@Title" options for the work itself, and @Code "@InAuthor" and
@Code "@InTitle" for the work that it appears within:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"{ @Reference"
"     @Tag { rieu1942intro }"
"     @Type { InBook }"
"     @Author { E. V. Rieu }"
"     @Title { Introduction to @I { The Odyssey } }"
"     @InAuthor { Homer }"
"     @InTitle { The Odyssey }"
"     @Publisher { Penguin }"
"     @Year { 1942 }"
"}"
}
@Code "@InAuthor" would often be absent or an editor.  The result is
@ID @RefPrint rieu1942intro
The other options are as for large works.  Type @Code InProceedings is
inproceedings.ref.type @Index { @Code InProceedings reference type }
similar to {@Code InBook}.
@PP
A database usually has a long life, and some day it might find itself
used in a document whose language is not the one its original compiler
had in mind.  For this reason, a truly meticulous compiler of database
entries would enclose @I all language-specific options in
@Code "@Language" symbols:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"{ @Reference"
"    @Tag { zimand1986size.sets.strings }"
"    @Type { Article }"
"    @Author { French @Language { M. Zimand } }"
"    @Title { English @Language { On the topological size of sets of random strings } }"
"    @Journal { German @Language { Zeitschr. f. math. Logik und Grundlagen d. Math. } }"
"    @Volume { 32 }"
"    @Pages { 81--88 }"
"    @Year { 1986 }"
"}"
}
(My apologies to M. Zimand if he or she is not French.)  This ensures
correct hyphenation whatever the language of the document in which the
reference appears.
