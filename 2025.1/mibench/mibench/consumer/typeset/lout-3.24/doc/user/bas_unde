The @Code "@Underline" symbol underlines the following object:
underline.sym @Index @Code "@Underline"
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"This little paragraph of text will have"
"@Underline { three underlined words } in it."
}
produces
@ID @OneRow 1.6i @Wide {
This little paragraph of text will have
@Underline { three underlined words } in it.
}
The underlining is continuous unless a line break intervenes.  You
can't use this symbol to underline an arbitrary object:  it is carefully
designed to produce high-quality underlining of single words and
parts of paragraphs, and it works only for those objects.
@PP
Each font contains information about how words in that font should be
underlined:  how far below the baseline the line should be drawn, and how
thick.  The @Code "@Underline" symbol uses this information; the font
it bases its underlining on is the font of the first object underlined
if it is a word, or else the font of the enclosing paragraph.
