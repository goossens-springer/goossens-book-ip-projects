@PP
Lout takes note of the titles of all your large-scale structure symbols
contents. @Index { contents, tables of }
tables.of.contents. @Index { tables of contents }
(Section {@NumberOf largescale}) and what pages they begin on, and it
uses this information to produce a table of contents like the one at
the start of the present document.  It is totally automatic; you do
nothing.
@PP
Some details of the appearance of the table of contents, including
whether to make one or not, are controlled by options in the setup
file.  The default setting is to make one in books but not to in
other types of documents, but by changing the setup file you can have
a table of contents in any type of document.
@PP
Section @NumberOf setup describes setup files in general and how to
change the options within them.  The options relevant to tables of
contents and their default values are:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@MakeContents { No }"
"@ContentsGap { 0.20v }"
"@ContentsGapAbove { 0.80v }"
"@ContentsGapBelow { 0.00v }"
"@ContentsLeader { .. }"
"@ContentsLeaderGap { 4s }"
"@ContentsRightWidth { 3f }"
}
The @Code "@MakeContents" option may be @Code Yes or {@Code No}, and
makecontents. @Index @Code "@MakeContents"
determines whether a table of contents is made or not.  Its default
value is @Code No but it is set to @Code Yes in the @Code book setup
file.
@PP
@Code "@ContentsGap" determines how much vertical space to leave
contentsgap. @Index @Code "@ContentsGap"
above each line of the table of contents, in addition to the usual
single line spacing; its value may be any length (Section
{@NumberOf objects}).  The default value, {@Code "0.20v"}, is twenty
percent of the current inter-line spacing.
@PP
Some entries, such as those for chapters and appendices in books, are
more important than others.  @Code "@ContentsGap" does not apply to these
entries; instead, @Code "@ContentsGapAbove" and @Code "@ContentsGapBelow"
contentsgapabove. @Index @Code "@ContentsGapAbove"
contentsgapbelow. @Index @Code "@ContentsGapBelow"
are used above and below each of them, again in addition to the usual
single line spacing.
@PP
@Code "@ContentsLeader" is the object which is repeated across the page
contentsleader. @Index @Code "@ContentsLeader"
to connect each entry with its page number; popular values are @Code ".."
and @Code "." and the empty object.  @Code "@ContentsLeaderGap" determines
contentsleadergap. @Index @Code "@ContentsLeaderGap"
how far apart these objects are; the default value, {@Code "4s"}, is
four times the width of a space character.  @Code "@ContentsLeaderGap"
may be {@Code "0s"}, but only if @Code "@ContentsLeader" is non-empty.
@PP
@Code "@ContentsRightWidth" reserves some
contentsrightwidth. @Index @Code "@ContentsRightWidth"
space at the far right for page numbers.  Any entry wide enough to
intrude into this space is broken into two or more lines to keep it
clear.
@PP
In addition to these options, each document type has options that
determine which large-scale structure symbols will be listed in the
table of contents.  For example, among the options to the
@Code "@BookSetup" symbol in the @Code book setup file are these:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@ChapterInContents { Yes }"
"@SectionInContents { Yes }"
"@SubSectionInContents { Yes }"
"@SubSubSectionInContents { No }"
"@AppendixInContents { Yes }"
"@SubAppendixInContents { Yes }"
"@SubSubAppendixInContents { No }"
}
Each may be either {@Code "Yes"} or {@Code "No"}; these default values
produce entries for everything except sub-subsections and sub-subappendices.
