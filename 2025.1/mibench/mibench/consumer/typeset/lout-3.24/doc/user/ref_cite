@PP
To cite one or more references, use the @Code "@Cite" symbol like this:
citing @Index { citing references }
cite. @Index @Code "@Cite"
@ID @Code {
"This feature is beyond our scope @Cite { $kingston1995lout.expert, page 97 }."
}
The following object must be enclosed in braces.  It may be an arbitrary
object as usual.  Within it the @Code "$" character is a symbol with a
special meaning:  it causes a citation to be made of the reference whose
@Code "@Tag" option is the word following the @Code "$" symbol:
@ID {
This feature is beyond our scope @Cite { $kingston1995lout.expert, page 97 }.
}
The reference itself will appear automatically in a reference list at
the end of the document, and the citation(s) will be enclosed in brackets
as shown.  There is no need to write @Code "${kingston1995lout.expert},"
as would normally be the case, because within @Code "@Cite" special
arrangements are made to prevent commas and semicolons from being a
nuisance.
@PP
A reference may be cited many times, but it will appear in the
reference list only once.  The references will ordinarily be sorted by
tag and labelled with Arabic numbers, although this can be changed by
setting options in the setup file (Section {@NumberOf changeref}).
@PP
If you are making a book, there is a @Code "@ChapCite" symbol which is
chap.cite @Index @Code "@ChapCite"
the same as @Code "@Cite" except that its references come out at the
end of the current preface, introduction, chapter, or appendix, rather
than at the end of the document.
@PP
It is quite all right to cite a reference from within a footnote, figure,
table, or index entry.  The reference will appear in the closest
reference list following the citation point in the final printed document,
or if there is no such list, the closest preceding reference list.  This
is fine in documents with just one reference list; but when using
@Code "@ChapCite" in books, if the citation point appears after the intended
reference list (because the footnote or figure has floated past the reference
list at the end of the chapter), the reference will come out in the wrong list.
@PP
Although it is frowned upon by the authorities, some people include
references which are not cited anywhere in the body of their document.  For
this there is {@Code "@NoCite"}:
no.cite @Index @Code "@NoCite"
@ID @Code {
"... our scope @NoCite { $kingston1995lout.expert, $kingston1993lout.design }."
}
produces
@ID {
... our scope @NoCite { $kingston1995lout.expert, $kingston1993lout.design }.
}
with the @Code "@NoCite" symbol and any preceding space removed.  The
references will nevertheless appear in the reference list as usual.  There
is a @Code "@NoChapCite" symbol that combines @Code "@NoCite" and
no.chap.cite @Index @Code "@NoChapCite"
{@Code "@ChapCite"}.  For compatibility with previous versions of Lout,
there is a @Code "@Ref" symbol:
ref. @Index @Code "@Ref"
@ID @Code "@Ref kingston1995lout.expert"
is the same as @Code "@Cite { $kingston1995lout.expert }" without the
brackets.  There are analogous {@Code "@ChapRef"}, {@Code "@NoRef"},
and {@Code "@NoChapRef"}
chap.ref @Index @Code "@ChapRef"
no.ref @Index @Code "@NoRef"
no.chap.ref @Index @Code "@NoChapRef"
symbols, which are not recommended.
@PP
The @Code "@RefPrint" symbol will print a reference on the spot:
ref.print @Index @Code "@RefPrint"
resume. @Index { resumes }
curriculum. @Index { curriculum vitae }
@ID @Code "@RefPrint kingston1995lout.expert"
has result
@ID @RefPrint kingston1995lout.expert
unrelated to any reference list.  For example,
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@Heading { Journal Articles }"
"@NumberedList"
"@LI @RefPrint kingston1985tree"
"..."
"@LI @RefPrint kingston1993lout.design"
"@EndList"
}
might appear in someone's resume.
