The simple way to make a list of references is to put them in a numbered
references. @Index { references }
or tagged list at the end of your document.  If you use references only
rarely, that is probably the best way, but if you use them frequently this
chapter will save you hours of work in the long run.

Some good general principles and many examples have been given by van Leunen
van.leunen. @Index { van Leunen, Mary-Claire }
@Cite { $vanleunen1992handbook }.  Broadly speaking Lout follows her
recommendations, with some unification and scaling back as is inevitable
with software.  Scribe @Cite { $reid1980scribe }
latex. @Index @LaTeX
scribe. @RawIndex Scribe
scribe.reference @SubIndex { reference formatting }
and @LaTeX @Cite { $lamport1986latex } followed the first edition of the
same source, so translation from Scribe and @LaTeX references is
fairly straightforward.
