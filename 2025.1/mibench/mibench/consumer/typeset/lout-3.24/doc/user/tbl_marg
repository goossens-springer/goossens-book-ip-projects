The @Code "@Cell" symbol offers a @Code margin option for changing the
margins @RawIndex { margins }
margins.in.tables @SubIndex { margins in tables }
amount of margin left between the entry and the boundary of the cell:
@ID @Code "@Cell margin { 0.3f }"
The default values are different for horizontal and vertical margins,
which brings us to the @Code marginhorizontal and @Code marginvertical
options:
@ID @OneRow @Code @Verbatim {
@Cell
    marginhorizontal { 0.6f }
    marginvertical { 0.3f }
}
These are the default values, 0.6 and 0.3 times the current font size
respectively.  Another useful value is {@Code "marginvertical { 0.5vx }"},
which asks for a vertical margin of half the current line separation, but
measured from baseline to baseline (this is what the @Code "x" means).
This produces a separation equal to the separation of the surrounding lines:
@CD @Tbl
    marginvertical { 0.5vx }
    aformat { @Cell A  |  @Cell B  |  @Cell C }
{
@Rowa
    A { Austen }
    B { Chaucer }
    C { Donne }
@Rowa
    A { Balzac }
    B { Darwin }
    C { Goethe }
@Rowa
    A { Byron }
    B { Dickens }
    C { Homer }
}
This margin does not work so well when the cells contain paragraphs,
diagrams or other things that could not be described as single lines.
@PP
There are {@Code "marginabove"}, {@Code "marginbelow"}, {@Code "marginleft"},
and {@Code "marginright"} options for setting margins individually.  For
example, sometimes you don't want the extreme left and right margins in
a table, and they can be got rid of like this:
@ID @OneRow @Code @Verbatim {
@Tbl
    paint { lightgrey }
    aformat { @Cell ml { 0i } A  |  @Cell B  |  @Cell mr { 0i } C }
{
@Rowa
    A { Column A }
    B { Column B }
    C { Column C }
}
}
We've used abbreviated versions of the options' names:  @Code "ml" for
{@Code marginleft}, and @Code "mr" for {@Code marginright}.  Every option
has such an abbreviated name, made from the first letters of the parts of
its full name (Section {@NumberOf tbl_summ} lists all these names).  The
result is
@DP @RCD @Tbl
    paint { lightgrey }
    aformat { @Cell ml { 0i } A  |  @Cell B  |  @Cell mr { 0i } C }
{
@Rowa
    A { Column A }
    B { Column B }
    C { Column C }
}
# with the painting showing the reduced margins.
