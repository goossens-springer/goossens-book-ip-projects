Directory lout/doc/user

This directory contains the Lout source files for the User's Guide
to the Lout Document Formatting System.  To produce the Guide,
type the command

	lout all > op

in this directory.  Owing to some unfortunate page breaks in the
early runs, this must be done six times to completely resolve
all cross references, although the PostScript file op is printable
after the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld suffixes
will be created in this directory.

The first run will produce a large number of error messages,
nearly all beginning with "unresolved cross reference".  These
should gradually go away on later runs.  The following shows the
error message output on the later runs for A4 size printing:

lout file "str_indx" (from "str" line 15, from "all" line 37):
    43,1: 0.3c object too high for -0.0c space; will try elsewhere
lout file "typ_repo" (from "typ" line 19, from "all" line 38):
    38,1: 1.0c object too high for 0.2c space; will try elsewhere
lout file "dia_synt" (from "dia" line 49, from "all" line 44):
    79,1: 1.0c object too high for 0.8c space; will try elsewhere
lout file "prg_tabs" (from "prg" line 102, from "all" line 46):
   58,23: prg2lout 2,1: program text ended within comment
   60,35: prg2lout 2,1: program text ended within comment

The first three warnings are about footnotes whose first lines did not
fit on the bottom of the current page, so had to begin on the following
page.  The last two warnings point to two places where a C program text
ended inside a comment, which in these cases was deliberate.  If you set
the document in Letter size paper, you will also get different warning
messages pointing to places where Lout had to slightly scale a display
to fit the smaller page:

lout file "gra_summ" (from "gra" line 44, from "all" line 45):
     8,1: 23.6c object too high for 21.8c space; @Scale inserted
lout file "ap_qck" (from "all" line 48):
  158,25: 22.4c object too high for 21.9c space; @Scale inserted

Optimal page breaking has been turned off for this document owing to
repeated failure to converge, caused by footnotes and floating figures
close to large unbreakable displays.

A copy of the final PostScript output file (A4 paper size) is
stored at "ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/jeff/lout/lout-3.24.user.ps.gz".
