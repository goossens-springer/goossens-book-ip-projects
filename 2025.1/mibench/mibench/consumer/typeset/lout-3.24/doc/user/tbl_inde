By default, entries appear at the left within cells, not counting the
cell margin.  The @Code indent option causes entries to be indented
horizontally.  For example,
@ID @OneRow @Code "@Cell indent { ctr }"
horizontally centres the entry within the cell.  Other possible values
centred.entries @Index { centred entries in tables }
right.justified.entries @Index { right justified entries in tables }
are {@Code "left"} (the default value), {@Code "right"},
{@Code "align"} (Section {@NumberOf tbl_alig}), or any length (for
example, {@Code 2f}) meaning that much indent.
@PP
There is a corresponding @Code "indentvertical" option for vertical indenting
within the cell.  It takes the same values except that @Code "left" is
renamed {@Code "top"} (the default), and @Code "right" is renamed
{@Code foot}.  A common problem with vertical placement is that words that
lack ascenders (parts of letters that rise up) or descenders (parts that
sink down) can easily become misaligned.  Looking at
@CD @Tbl
    mv { 0i }
    aformat { @Cell A | @Cell B | @Cell C }
{
@Rowa
    A { resume }
    B { poppy }
    C { title }
}
which is the result of
@ID @OneRow @Code @Verbatim {
@Tbl
    aformat { @Cell A | @Cell B | @Cell C }
{
@Rowa
    A { resume }
    B { poppy }
    C { title }
}
}
we see that the words are aligned correctly despite these
worries.  This is because by default
@Code "@Tbl" adds a @I { vertical strut } to each entry:  an invisible
object of zero width and height {@Code "1f"}, which covers for any absent
ascenders and descenders.  The option
@ID @OneRow @Code "@Cell strut { no }"
can be used to remove the strut; other acceptable values for this
option are {@Code yes} (the default value), and any length, which will
add a strut of that length.
@PP
For completeness there is a corresponding @Code "struthorizontal" option; it
takes the same values, its default value is {@Code no}, and it unlikely
ever to be used.
