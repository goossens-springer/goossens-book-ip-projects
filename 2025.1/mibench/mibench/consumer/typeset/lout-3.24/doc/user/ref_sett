The basic idea is to store your references in a separate
database.file @Index { database file }
@I { database file }, in a form which does not include formatting
details such as font changes.  This makes it easy to use the same
references in many documents, and it leaves the formatting to Lout.  Here
is an example of a reference as it would appear in a database file:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"{ @Reference"
"    @Tag { vanleunen1992 }"
"    @Type { Book }"
"    @Author { Mary-Claire van Leunen }"
"    @Title { A Handbook for Scholars }"
"    @Publisher { Oxford }"
"    @Edition { Revised Edition }"
"    @Year { 1992 }"
"}"
}
reference. @Index @Code "@Reference"
@Code "@Reference" is a symbol, and {@Code "@Tag"}, {@Code "@Type"},
{@Code "@Author"}, and so on are its options.  The database file as
a whole consists of a sequence of references, each enclosed in braces
as shown.
@PP
The @Code "@Tag" option is compulsory:  since you cite a reference by
giving its tag, there must be one.  The @Code "@Type" option is also
type. @Index { @Code "@Type" option }
compulsory, since it says whether the reference is to a book, a journal
article, or whatever, and this determines what other options are
required.  Section {@NumberOf entries} describes all the types provided
by Lout, and Section {@NumberOf refstyles} explains how to add your own.
@PP
Lout database file names must end in {@Code ".ld"}, so now suppose that
you have made one called
ld.file @Index { @Code ".ld" file }
refs.ld.file @Index { @Code "refs.ld" file }
@Code "refs.ld" and put it in the same directory as your document.  Next,
place
@ID @Code "@Database @Reference { refs }"
database. @Index @Code "@Database"
at the start of your document, just before {@Code "@Doc"},
{@Code "@Document"}, {@Code "@Report"}, or whatever.  Alternatively,
you may place it at the end of your setup file.  It informs Lout that
you might be referring to @Code "@Reference" symbols in database
@Code "refs" (that is, in file {@Code "refs.ld"}).
@PP
If you want to maintain a central database, used by many documents, you
won't want it in the same directory as any one of them.  A Unix
pathname will be more appropriate:
@ID @Code "@Database @Reference { \"/usr/jeff/lib/refs\" }"
or whatever.  Quotes are needed because of the @Code "/" characters.
@PP
With the database file created and the @Code "@Database" line in place,
you are ready to start citing references.  The first time that the
database.index.file @Index { database index file }
index.file @Index { index file }
database is used, Lout will create an @I { index file } whose purpose
is to speed up the retrieval of your references.  Thanks to this file
you can have hundreds or even thousands of references in your database,
without slowing Lout down very much.  However, whenever you change your
database file @I { you must remove its corresponding index file }, so
that Lout knows to create it afresh.
@FootNote {
Depending on how it was installed on your system, Lout may be able to
use the time of last modification of the database file and its index
file to determine automatically whether the index file needs to be
created afresh, thus saving you the trouble of removing it.  You can
find out whether this is true of your system by typing the command
{@Code "lout -V"}.
}
 The index file is stored in the
same directory as the database file, and it has the same name except
that it ends in @Code ".li" rather than @Code ".ld" (e.g.
li.file @Index { @Code ".li" file }
{@Code "refs.li"}).
@PP
If a separate database file is not convenient for some reason, perhaps
because you need a self-contained document in a single file, the
@Code "@Reference" symbols may be incorporated into the document
itself, anywhere that ordinary text may appear.  Nothing will appear
where they are typed in, but Lout will notice them and treat them as if
they had come from a database file.  In this case no @Code "@Database"
symbol is needed unless you are referring to a database as well.
@PP
You may have multiple databases, like this:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@Database @Reference { myrefs }"
"@Database @Reference { \"/usr/pub/refs/theoryrefs\" }"
}
Lout will search the databases in the order you list them.
