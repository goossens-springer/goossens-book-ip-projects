There are @Code "@Sup" and @Code "@Sub" symbols for producing
superscripts and subscripts:
@ID @Code "2 @Sup nd"
produces
@ID { 2 @Sup nd }
and the @Code "@Sub" symbol works in a similar way.  These symbols
are probably never required in English language text, since the
only uses for them are in footnotes, which produce the superscript
automatically, and equations, which have their own versions of these
symbols.  Both symbols have a @Code "gap" option which determines the
vertical spacing.
