@PP
Printing of program files independently of any document is accomplished by
the following Unix pipeline:
@ID @Code "prg2lout  -l language  options  files  |  lout  -s  >  out.ps"
where @Code language stands for any one of the programming language
names in the first column of the table above.  As usual with Lout, the
output will be a PostScript file.  Each input file will begin on a new
page of the output, starting with its name in bold type.  The options
provide control over the final appearance, as follows:
@WideTaggedList
@TI { {@Code-p}{@I style} } {
Select a printing style.  Your choices are {@Code -pfixed},
{@Code -pvarying}, and {@Code -psymbol}, with the default value
varying with the language as given in the fourth column of the
table above.  Consult Section {@NumberOf embedded} for examples
of these styles.
}
@TI { @Code -n } {
Do not print file names.
}
@TI { {@Code -f}{@I font} } {
Select a Lout font family.  The default is @Code "-fCourier" for
{@Code -pfixed}, and @Code "-fTimes" for @Code -pvarying and {@Code -psymbol}.
}
@TI { {@Code -v}{@I vsize} } {
Select an inter-line spacing size in Lout units.  The default is
@Code -v1.1fx meaning 1.1 times the font size measured from baseline
to baseline.
}
@TI { {@Code -L}{@I number} } {
Add line numbers to the program print, starting with {@I number}, or
1 if {@I number} is omitted.
}
@TI { {@Code -S}{@I file} } {
Use @I file as the setup file for printing your language.  This allows
you to change all the options mentioned in subsequent sections, rather
than just the few given here.
}
@EndList
There are also {@Code -t} and {@Code -T} options for dealing with tab
characters (Section {@NumberOf tabs}).
