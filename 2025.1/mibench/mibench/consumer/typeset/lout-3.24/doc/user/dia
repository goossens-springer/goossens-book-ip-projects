This chapter describes how to use the @@Diag symbol
diag. @Index { @@Diag }
@FootNote {
Starting with Version 3.18 of Lout, the @@Diag symbol was enhanced with
the {@Code "@ANode"}, {@Code "@BNode"}, and {@Code "@CNode"} symbols
described in Section {@NumberOf dia_node}, and with the symbols for
syntax diagrams described in Section {@NumberOf dia_synt}.
#These
#enhancements are upwardly compatible, unless the user has defined
#symbols with these same names and used them within diagrams.
@LP
Prior to Version 3.09 of Lout, this chapter described a symbol called
fig. @Index @Code "@Fig"
{@Code "@Fig"} which was similar to but more primitive than
{@Code "@Diag"}.  For backward compatibility the @Code "@Fig" symbol
is still available and still works exactly as described in the old
documentation, but there is no reason to use it in new documents.
}
to make diagrams like this one:
diag. @Index @Code "@Diag"
@CD @Diag
    margin { 0.2c }
{
-2p @Font
{ A:: @Ellipse { 25, 39 }
/0.3c |0.2c B:: @Ellipse { 43 } |0.1c |0.8c E:: @Box outlinestyle {noline} {Problem node}
/0.3c C:: @Ellipse { 40, 41 } | | D:: @Ellipse paint { lightgrey } {44, 45, 46}
}
// @Link from { A } to { B }
// @Link from { B } to { C }
// @Link from { B } to { D }
// @Arrow from { E } to { D }
}
@@Diag offers nodes and links, arrows, labels, coordinates,
tree diagrams, and syntax diagrams.
