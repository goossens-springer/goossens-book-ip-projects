The @Code "@Rotate" symbol rotates the following object by any positive
rotate. @Index @Code "@Rotate"
or negative angle, measured in degrees:
@ID @Code "45d @Rotate @Box WARNING!"
has result
@ID { 45d @Rotate @Box WARNING! }
As usual, the object to be rotated may be arbitrary.  However, it is
difficult for Lout to choose appropriate column widths for paragraphs
inside rotated objects, so if a rotated object contains paragraphs that
should be broken it is best to define the object's width explicitly,
using the @Code "@Wide" symbol:
wide @RawIndex { @Code "@Wide" }
wide.rotate @SubIndex { with @Code "@Rotate" }
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"-90d @Rotate 4.5c @Wide {"
"Papal initiatives and influence from the crowning of"
"Charlemagne to the First Crusade"
"}"
}
The result here is
@ID {
-90d @Rotate 4.5c @Wide {
Papal initiatives and influence from the crowning of
Charlemagne to the First Crusade
}
}
The @Code "@Wide" symbol fixes the width of the following object, in
this example to the length 4.5 centimetres, which is all Lout needs to
decide the column widths of any paragraphs within it.
