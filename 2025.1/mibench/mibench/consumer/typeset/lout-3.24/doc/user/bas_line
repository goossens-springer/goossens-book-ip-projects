The @Code "@Break" symbol also controls the amount of space placed
line.spacing @Index { line spacing }
between the lines of paragraphs.  This distance is best given using the
@Code "v" unit of measurement:  @Code "1v" is the current line
separation (see Section {@NumberOf objects} for a description of
lengths in general).  For example,
@ID @Code "2vx @Break ..."
produces double spacing in the paragraphs of the following object, and
double.spacing @Index { double spacing }
@ID @Code "0.9vx @Break ..."
produces cramped spacing, which can be useful in large tables that don't
quite fit on one page.  The @Code "x" following the @Code "v" is required,
but its meaning is beyond our scope @Cite { $kingston1995lout.expert }.
@PP
To set the entire document in a different line spacing from the
initialbreak @Index @Code "@InitialBreak"
default, you need to change the @Code "@InitialBreak" option.  If you
are using your own setup file (Section {@NumberOf setup}),
change it there.  If not, you can change it at the beginning of your
document, as described in Section {@NumberOf ordinary}.
@PP
The default value of the @Code "@InitialBreak" option produces the
@Code "adjust" paragraph breaking style with a line spacing of 1.20
times the current (that is, the initial) font size, and hyphenation
on:
@ID @Code "@InitialBreak { adjust 1.20fx hyphen }"
To get double spacing, change it to
@ID @Code "@InitialBreak { adjust 2.40fx hyphen }"
To get ragged paragraphs with hyphenation off, change it to
@ID @Code "@InitialBreak { ragged 1.20fx nohyphen }"
and so on.  It is a good idea to define the initial line spacing using
the @Code "f" unit, since then if you change the initial font size the
line spacing will change with it.  However, any length (Section
{@NumberOf objects}) with an @Code "x" appended will do:  @Code "14px"
for 14 point, @Code "0.5cx" for 0.5 centimetres, etc.  Don't use the
@Code "v" unit though, because it refers to some @I previous line
spacing, whereas here we are defining the line spacing for the first time.
