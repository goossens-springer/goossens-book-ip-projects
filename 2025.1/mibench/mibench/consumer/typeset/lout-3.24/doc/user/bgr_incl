@PP
The @Code "@IncludeGraphic" symbol incorporates into a Lout document an
include.graphic @Index @Code "@IncludeGraphic"
include.illus @Index { including an illustration }
illustration (that is, an encapsulated PostScript or EPS file)
produced by other means.  For the opposite process, using Lout to produce
an illustration for inclusion in some other document, see
Section {@NumberOf illustrations}.
@PP
For example, suppose the encapsulated PostScript file @Code "su_crest.eps"
contains the University of Sydney crest.  Then
@ID @Code "@IncludeGraphic su_crest.eps"
produces
@ID @IncludeGraphic su_crest.eps
In general, the result produced by @Code "@IncludeGraphic" is an object
that may be scaled, rotated, made into a display or placed within a
paragraph, just like any other object.  Accolades for this remarkable
flexibility should go to the PostScript page description language,
whose extraordinary power makes the provision of this feature in Lout
almost trivial.
@PP
The @Code "@IncludeGraphic" command understands that files ending
with any of the suffixes {@Code ".gz"}, {@Code "-gz"}, {@Code ".z"},
{@Code "-z"}, {@Code "_z"}, and {@Code ".Z"} are compressed files,
and it will uncompress such files using the @Code "gunzip" command
before including them.  The uncompressed version is stored in a file
called @Code "lout.eps" in the current directory, and removed after
being copied into the output file.
@PP
If you place an included illustration in a line of text, or anywhere
where you care about its alignment with things on either side of it,
it will be positioned with its centre at the same height as the
centre of the letter x.  If this is not where you want it, use the
@Code "@VShift" symbol:
vshift. @Index @Code "@VShift"
@ID @Code "... +0.5f @VShift @IncludeGraphic ..."
prints the illustration half of the current font size higher on the
page than would otherwise have been the case, and
@ID @Code "... -0.5f @VShift @IncludeGraphic ..."
prints it half the current font size lower.  Any length (Section
{@NumberOf objects}) is allowed, and the object following @Code "@VShift"
may in fact be arbitrary as usual.
