The Lout definitions for graph formatting are kept in a file called
{@Code "graph"}, which you must include at the start of your document if
graph.file @Index { @Code "graph" file }
you want graphs, like this:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@SysInclude { graph }"
"@SysInclude { doc }"
"@Doc @Text @Begin"
"..."
"@End @Text"
}
Setup files for specialized packages, such as {@Code "graph"}, should be
included before the main setup file.  Once this is done, the @Code "@Graph"
symbol used below will then be available for use anywhere within your document.
@PP
@Code "@Graph" distinguishes between the overall graph, produced by the
@Code "@Graph" symbol itself, and the data sets to be placed within it,
each of which is enclosed by a @Code "@Data" symbol:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@CentredDisplay @Graph"
"{"
"    @Data  points { plus }"
"    { 1 1.10  2 1.21  3 1.33  4 1.46  5 1.61  6 1.77  7 1.95  8 2.14 }"
""
"    @Data  points { circle }"
"    { 1 1.20  2 1.44  3 1.73  4 2.07  5 2.45  6 2.99  7 3.58  8 4.30 }"
"}"
}
Although it is good practice to lay the input data out neatly, layout
has no effect on the result.  It is not necessary to have one data point
per line, for example.  The result of this example is
@CentredDisplay @Graph
{
    @Data
        points { plus }
    { 1 1.10  2 1.21  3 1.33  4 1.46  5 1.61  6 1.77  7 1.95  8 2.14 }

    @Data
        points { circle }
    { 1 1.20  2 1.44  3 1.73  4 2.07  5 2.45  6 2.99  7 3.58  8 4.30 }
}
We have used the @Code "@CentredDisplay" symbol from Section
{@NumberOf displays} to produce a centred display, but the
@Code "@Graph" symbol produces an object which may appear anywhere
at all -- in a figure, for example, or as an entry in a table.
