@PP
There are two symbols for producing drop capitals, {@Code "@DropCapTwo"}
drop.cap.two.sym @Index @Code "@DropCapTwo"
drop.cap.three.sym @Index @Code "@DropCapThree"
and {@Code "@DropCapThree"}.  Place the capital to be dropped just
before the symbol, and the rest of the paragraph after it:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"I @DropCapTwo {"
"t is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man"
"in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."
"}"
}
produces the object
@ID 3i @Wide {
I @DropCapTwo {
t is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man
in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
}
}
@Code "@DropCapThree" is the same except that the capital is larger
and spreads over three lines.
@PP
Because Lout occasionally gets the height of the enlarged capital
slightly wrong, there is a @Code "height" option which allows you
to change the height if you need to:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"H @DropCapTwo height { 1.5v }"
"{"
"   ..."
"}"
}
This shows the default value for the height of the capital in
{@Code "@DropCapTwo"}:  1.5 times the current inter-line
spacing.  The default height in @Code "@DropCapThree" is {@Code "2.5v"}.
@PP
These symbols produce an object which may appear anywhere in the
usual way.  A paragraph symbol will be needed after the paragraph.  The
paragraph breaking style of the body of the paragraph will be
{@Code "adjust nohyphen"}; this cannot be changed at present.
