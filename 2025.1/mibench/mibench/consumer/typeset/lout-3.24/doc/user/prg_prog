The standard reference for the Eiffel language @Cite { $meyer1992eiffel }
specifies that identifiers within comments may or should be enclosed
in ` and ' so that they may be noticed and printed in an italic
font:
@ID @OneRow @Code @Verbatim {
@ID @Eiffel {
deposit(amount: REAL) is
        -- deposit `amount' dollars
}
}
produces
@ID @OneRow @Eiffel {
deposit(amount: REAL) is
	-- deposit `amount' dollars
}
This has been generalized in Lout:  arbitrary text within an
Eiffel comment between ` and ' will be treated as Eiffel text and
printed accordingly.  Some other languages may also offer this
feature:  see the fifth column of the table at the start of this
chapter.  In principle the precise means of getting it could vary
from language to language, but the languages available at the moment
either do not have it at all, or else they use ` and ' like Eiffel.
@PP
On the subject of Eiffel, the Eiffel reference @Cite { $meyer1992eiffel }
has some quite detailed style guidelines, and these have been closely
followed in the implementation of the @Code "@Eiffel" symbol.  In
particular, @Code "@Eiffel" prints dots larger than usual when they
denote feature calls, as the example @OneCol @Eiffel { account.deposit(20) }
shows.
