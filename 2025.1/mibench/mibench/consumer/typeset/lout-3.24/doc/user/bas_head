The @Code "@Heading" symbol makes the following object into a
heading. @Index @Code "@Heading"
heading.  Actually, all it does is change the font, so if you want a
centred heading you have to display it as well:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@Display @Heading { A Centred Heading }"
"Following text"
}
If you want a left-justified heading, use @Code "@LeftDisplay" instead
of @Code {"@Display"}.  Alternatively, you can use no display symbol at
all, but then you will need paragraph symbols before and after:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"@DP"
"@Heading { A Left-Justified Heading }"
"@PP"
"Following text"
}
The font used is @Code Bold in the current family, although you can
change this by changing the @Code "@HeadingFont" option in the setup
headingfont. @Index @Code "@HeadingFont"
file (Section {@NumberOf setup}).
@PP
The @Code "@Heading" symbol may be used with any type of document, but it
is really intended only for simple ones.  In complex documents, large-scale
structure symbols (Section {@NumberOf largescale}) are usually more
appropriate.
