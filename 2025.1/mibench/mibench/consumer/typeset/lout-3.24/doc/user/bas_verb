The @Code "@Verbatim" symbol
@FootNote { Prior to Version 3.13 the @Code "@Verbatim" symbol was
implemented in a way that restricted its availability to Unix
systems only.  This restriction no longer applies. }
prints the following object exactly as
verbatim.sym @Index @Code "@Verbatim"
it appears in the input file.  All special meanings for characters,
symbols, etc. are turned off; there is one result line for
each input line.  For example,
@ID @Code @Verbatim {
@IndentedDisplay @Verbatim {
A line of "verbatim" text
Another line, with a \ character
}
}
has result
@IndentedDisplay @Verbatim {
A line of "verbatim" text
Another line, with a \ character
}
Use @Code "@F @Verbatim { ... }" to get the result in a fixed-width font.
@PP
If the verbatim text contains @Code "{" or @Code "}" characters, then
they should either be balanced or else you need to use the alternative
form
@ID @Code {
"@Verbatim @Begin"
"..."
"@End @Verbatim"
}
so that there is no doubt about where the verbatim text ends.  Although
we have said that there are no special meanings, there is one exception
to this rule:  @Code "@Include" and @Code "@SysInclude" commands are
recognized, allowing all or part of the verbatim text to come from some
other file.
@PP
Occasionally the first line of some verbatim text begins with some
spaces that have to be preserved.  This is a problem for @Code "@Verbatim"
because it ignores all white spaces following the opening brace and
all white spaces preceding the closing brace.  However, the alternative
@Code "@RawVerbatim" symbol stops ignoring white spaces at the opening
as soon as a newline character is reached; in other words, it will
preserve all white spaces following the first newline.
