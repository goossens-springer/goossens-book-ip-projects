Directory lout/doc/slides

This directory contains the Lout source of
a set of overhead transparencies entitled
`A Practical Introduction to the Lout
Document Formatting System.'  To format
the transparencies, type

	lout all > outfile.ps

in this directory.  This needs to be done
twice to resolve all cross references.
There should be no error messages at all
after the second run.  A copy of the final
outfile.ps is included.
