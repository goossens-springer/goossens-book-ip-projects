Locale-specific error messages

Lout offers the option of locale-specific error messages.  To
get them, install with USELOC set to 1 in the make file, as
described in detail there.  If USELOC is set to 1 when installing,
Lout will look for a file called $(LIBDIR)/locale/msgs.<loc>
where <loc> stands for the current locale, for its error messages.

At present we have

  msgs.english.3.16  The up-to-date messages list, in English
  old.msgs.fr	     French messages from Version 3.05, out of date
  old.msgs.de	     German messages from Version 3.05, out of date

Someone needs to translate the new errors list into these languages
(and others) and send it to me.  Please send me any translations you
do (perhaps ask first) so that I can stop people doing duplicate work.
