THE LOUT DOCUMENT FORMATTING SYSTEM

Lout is a document formatting system similar in style to LaTeX.  It
offers a very full range of features, including PostScript, PDF, and
plain text output, optimal paragraph and page breaking, automatic
hyphenation, PostScript EPS file inclusion and generation, equation
formatting, tables, diagrams, rotation and scaling, sorted indexes,
bibliographic databases, running headers and odd-even pages, automatic
cross referencing, multilingual documents including hyphenation (most
European languages are supported, including Russian), formatting of
computer programs, and more.  Lout may be extended by writing definitions
which are much simpler than the equivalent troff of TeX macros.

Lout is written in highly portable ANSI C and runs on most platforms.
It is distributed under the GNU public license.  Its primary web site is

   ftp://ftp.cs.usyd.edu.au/jeff/lout/

Consult the README file in that directory for information about the
latest version.

Lout was designed and implemented by Jeffrey H. Kingston (jeff@cs.usyd.edu.au)
of the Basser Department of Computer Science at the University of Sydney.
