Lout-related software form elsewhere
====================================

This directory contains information about software related to
Lout but not distributed with Lout.  For various practical
reasons, such as size, licenses, version control, etc., it was
considered better not to bundle this with Lout itself.  This
directory is maintained by Jeff Kingston, but he exercises no
editorial control over it beyond checking that the software
advertised in it appears to have some connection with Lout.  In
particular, there is no guarantee that the stuff exists, works,
is compatible, is supported by its author, etc.  Use at own risk.
