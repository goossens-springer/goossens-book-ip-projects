Compile Instructions
--------------------
1)  Change directories to ../tiff-v3.5.4.
2)  Type "./configure" to configure the Makefile for your system.  Select
    all default options.
3)  Type "make".  This will create the executables used by the scripts. If
    this doesn't work see the tiff-v3.5.4/README file for more details on
    how to fix or modify the install process.

NOTE:  This install process will create the executables that are used by
the four different variants of tiff that are used in the MiBench suite.
In other words, you only need to do this once.

Clean Instructions
------------------
1)  Change directories to tiff-v3.5.4.
2)  Type "make distclean".  This will delete post-compile files (i.e.
    old executables, output, object files, etc...).
