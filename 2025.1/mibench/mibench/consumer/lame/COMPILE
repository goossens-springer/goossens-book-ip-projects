Compile Instructions
--------------------
1)  Change directories to lame3.70.
2)  Type "make".  This will create the executables used by the scripts. If
    this doesn't work see the lame3.70/INSTALL file for details on how to
    fix or modify the install process.

Clean Instructions
------------------
1)  Change directories to lame3.70.
2)  Type "make clean".  This will delete post-compile files (i.e.
    old executables, output, object files, etc...).
