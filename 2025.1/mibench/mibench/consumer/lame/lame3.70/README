Originally developed by Mike Cheng (www.uq.net.au/~zzmcheng).  Now 
maintained by Mark Taylor (www.sulaco.org/mp3).

This is a patch against the ISO MPEG2 dist10 demonstration source.  The
modifications are distributed under the GNU LESSER PUBLIC LICENSE
(LGPL, see www.gnu.org) with the following modification:

1. If you determine that distribution of LAME requires a patent license,
   and you obtain a patent license, you may distribute LAME even though
   redistribution of LAME may also require a patent license.  

2. You agree not to enforce any patent claims for any aspect of
   MPEG audio compression, or any other techniques contained in 
   the LAME source code.

The graphical frame analyzer uses the MPGLIB decoding engine, from the
MPG123 package, written by: Michael Hipp (www.mpg123.de) MPGLIB is
released under the GPL, while MPG123 is released under a more
