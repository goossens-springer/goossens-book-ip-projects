0.   ./configure script

things to check for:  

   -llibsndfile      (allow user to enable)
   -lncurses         
   -lGTK             (allow user to disable)
   make depend option for CC




1. Modularization:

BladeEnc.dll was written before lame was 'modularized'
this should be cleaned up to look like main.c:  It should be possible
to write the BladeEnc/lame dll so that it just uses
#include "lame.h" and then calls to various lame_*() routines


2.
Does stdin work when LAME is compiled to use libsndfile? 
(new version of libsndfile will support this - try this out)

3.
LAME uses a linear downsampling with simple lowpass filter
on the MDCT/polyphase coefficients.  Is this good enough, or
would a more expensive filter give better results?

4.
make use of subblock_gain (crude algorithm enabled with -Z) 
   One method:  loop over all possible subblock_gains and
   see which combination gives best distortion?  But this puts a lot
   of faith in the short block psycho acoustics

5.
make use of scalefactor_select  (crude algorithm enabled with -Y)

6.
10Hz high-pass filter.  Probably wont help much.
