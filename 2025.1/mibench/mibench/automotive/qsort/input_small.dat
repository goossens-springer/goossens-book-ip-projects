Wear
sunscreen
If
I
could
offer
you
only
one
tip
for
the
future
sunscreen
would
be
it
The
longterm
benefits
of
sunscreen
have
been
proved
by
scientists
whereas
the
rest
of
my
advice
has
no
basis
more
reliable
than
my
own
meandering
experience
I
will
dispense
this
advice
now
Enjoy
the
power
and
beauty
of
your
youth
Oh
never
mind
You
will
not
understand
the
power
and
beauty
of
your
youth
until
theyve
faded
But
trust
me
in
20
years
youll
look
back
at
photos
of
yourself
and
recall
in
a
way
you
cant
grasp
now
how
much
possibility
lay
before
you
and
how
fabulous
you
really
looked
You
are
not
as
fat
as
you
imagine
Dont
worry
about
the
future
Or
worry
but
know
that
worrying
is
as
effective
as
trying
to
solve
an
algebra
equation
by
chewing
bubble
gum
The
real
troubles
in
your
life
are
apt
to
be
things
that
never
crossed
your
worried
mind
the
kind
that
blindside
you
at
4
pm
on
some
idle
Tuesday
Do
one
thing
every
day
that
scares
you
Sing
Dont
be
reckless
with
other
peoples
hearts
Dont
put
up
with
people
who
are
reckless
with
yours
Floss
Dont
waste
your
time
on
jealousy
Sometimes
youre
ahead
sometimes
youre
behind
The
race
is
long
and
in
the
end
its
only
with
yourself
Remember
compliments
you
receive
Forget
the
insults
If
you
succeed
in
doing
this
tell
me
how
Keep
your
old
love
letters
Throw
away
your
old
bank
statements
Stretch
Dont
feel
guilty
if
you
dont
know
what
you
want
to
do
with
your
life
The
most
interesting
people
I
know
didnt
know
at
22
what
they
wanted
to
do
with
their
lives
Some
of
the
most
interesting
40yearolds
I
know
still
dont
Get
plenty
of
calcium
Be
kind
to
your
knees
Youll
miss
them
when
theyre
gone
Maybe
youll
marry
maybe
you
wont
Maybe
youll
have
children
maybe
you
wont
Maybe
youll
divorce
at
40
maybe
youll
dance
the
funky
chicken
on
your
75th
wedding
anniversary
Whatever
you
do
dont
congratulate
yourself
too
much
or
berate
yourself
either
Your
choices
are
half
chance
So
are
everybody
elses
Enjoy
your
body
Use
it
every
way
you
can
Dont
be
afraid
of
it
or
of
what
other
people
think
of
it
Its
the
greatest
instrument
youll
ever
own
Dance
even
if
you
have
nowhere
to
do
it
but
your
living
room
Read
the
directions
even
if
you
dont
follow
them
Do
not
read
beauty
magazines
They
will
only
make
you
feel
ugly
Get
to
know
your
parents
You
never
know
when
theyll
be
gone
for
good
Be
nice
to
your
siblings
Theyre
your
best
link
to
your
past
and
the
people
most
likely
to
stick
with
you
in
the
future
Understand
that
friends
come
and
go
but
with
a
precious
few
you
should
hold
on
Work
hard
to
bridge
the
gaps
in
geography
and
lifestyle
because
the
older
you
get
the
more
you
need
the
people
who
knew
you
when
you
were
young
Live
in
New
York
City
once
but
leave
before
it
makes
you
hard
Live
in
Northern
California
once
but
leave
before
it
makes
you
soft
Travel
Accept
certain
inalienable
truths
Prices
will
rise
Politicians
will
philander
You
too
will
get
old
And
when
you
do
youll
fantasize
that
when
you
were
young
prices
were
reasonable
politicians
were
noble
and
children
respected
their
elders
Respect
your
elders
Dont
expect
anyone
else
to
support
you
Maybe
you
have
a
trust
fund
Maybe
youll
have
a
wealthy
spouse
But
you
never
know
when
either
one
might
run
out
Dont
mess
too
much
with
your
hair
or
by
the
time
youre
40
it
will
look
85
Be
careful
whose
advice
you
buy
but
be
patient
with
those
who
supply
it
Advice
is
a
form
of
nostalgia
Dispensing
it
is
a
way
of
fishing
the
past
from
the
disposal
wiping
it
off
painting
over
the
ugly
parts
and
recycling
it
for
more
than
its
worth
But
trust
me
on
the
